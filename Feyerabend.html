            <p>
                Paul Feyerabend was one of the most intriguing figures in the
                20th-century philosophy of science. A student of Karl Popper,
                he came to stridently reject his former teacher's
                "rationalistic" view of science, and (in)famously
                endorsed an "anything goes" philosophy of science
                that he called "methodological anarchy." This position
                led him to be called an "enemy of science" by <i>Nature</i>
                magazine (pg. vii).
            </p>
 
            <p>
                The work under review here was not published during
                Feyerabend's lifetime. It is essentially the first volume
                "plus" of a projected three-volume 
                work tracing the development of the
                philosophy of nature from paleolithic times, through the
                ancient Greeks, and up to recent developments in relativity and
                quantum mechanics. Volume one was projected to finish with the
                pre-Socratics, volume two would run from Plato up through the
                Renaissance, and volume three would run from there to the
                present day. Volumes two and three have been rolled into volume
                one here in the form of much briefer chapters from what
                were intended to have been book length works.
                But even in this truncated form, this book
                presents a new face of the "gadfly"
                Feyerabend to the philosophical community: that of the serious
                scholar of the history of philosophical thought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feyerabend's starting point, the neolithic understanding of
                nature, is important in that historians and 
                philosophers of science have
                seldom regarded the "primitive"
                knowledge of nature as anything more
                than ignorance and superstition (see Wootton, 2015, for a
                representative example). That is a view Feyerabend vigorously
                rejects. For instance, he writes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                The assumption that humans of the Stone or Bronze Age would 
                have had only the most primitive knowledge of nature may be
                flattering to our progressivist self-image. But it has little
                plausibility since Stone Age humans were already fully
                developed members of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and it is
                incompatible with recent research.
                The environmental and societal
                problems that the early <i>Homo sapiens</i> had to face were
                incomparably greater than the challenges facing our contemporary
                scientists. These problems had to be solved with the most
                primitive means, often without any division of labor or
                specialized skills, and the solutions arrived at indicate a
                level of intelligence and sensitivity that
                is clearly not inferior to ours. (5-6)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                He insists that we take the neolithic view, which he sees as
                persisting up through the time of Homer in the Greek world,
                seriously: these people really did have the
                experiences the historical evidence indicates that they had:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                An animated world, divine intervention, 
                the 'openness' of the soul's life are
                not preconceptions or errors or 
                results of a superficial approach, but clearly
                recognizable components of this experience 
                of the world, and their elimination
                constitutes an elimination of important knowledge. (90)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                However, Feyerabend asserts, we see the signs of the breakdown
                of this understanding of the cosmos even in Homer, and the
                breakdown becomes more pronounced in Hesiod, and in the
                pre-Socratic philosophers. In a sense, the philosophers
                "rationalized" cosmology, but they did so only by excluding
                large parts of experience:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Thus, Anaximander's universe and its later modifications are
                uniform. <em>And yet they are not complete.</em>
                They do not contain
                mythological events, dreams or spawns of imagination... We push
                the events in question out of our physical world and into
                another world, which is conceived of either as a world
                consisting... of non-reality, or as a very
                real yet non-physical world... In both cases we obtain an
                antiseptic real (physical) world at the expense of
                insurmountable problems: how can we reunify domains that are so
                radically separate? Increased specialization makes the problems
                disappear from the researchers' horizon... (126-132)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Indeed, the purported "rationality" of the view emerging with
                the Greek philosophers does not stand up to empirical scrutiny:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                the disappearance of the gods... today...
                is generally regarded as
                'rational'... Yet this means identifying
                rationalism with materialism -- a dubitable
                procedure based on a naive naturalistic
                interpretation of the material. It indicates an
                oversight of the possibility that materialism may 
                have <em>contradicted</em> the contemporary experience of 
                the world, and so it may be considered 'irrational' 
                in light of an empiricist methodology. (105)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Feyerabend argues that, in the new philosophy of nature,
                abstractions come to be seen as more real than concrete
                reality, pointing out that, for instance, in Parmenides we
                already see "reality" being assigned to paradoxical, abstract
                notions, rather than to concrete experience.
                Per Feyerabend, far from fixing this situation, modern science
                has simply hardened it in its institutional structures:
            </p>

                
            <blockquote>
                The rift was never entirely overcome;
                rather, the 'real world' became ever 
                more remote from the world in
                which we live and feel. It becomes institutionalized until
                eventually the power of the growing 
                institutions of science and an
                education regulated by them closes the 
                rift from the other end by
                means of a kind of training 
                that keeps transforming intuition, the
                behavior regulated by it, and thereby 
                us humans as well until we
                obey the scientific forms of 
                thought and see the world through
                them, as a junk room deserted by 
                gods yet well organized. (153)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Feyerabend goes on to describe how this new attitude to nature,
                one that cleaves the world of experience into a "subjective"
                realm that includes dreams, myths, emotions, and even sense
                qualities, and an "objective" realm consisting only of what can
                measured and thus quantified, gradually hardened into a
                "fundamentalist" epistemology disconnected from the actual
                practice of science:
            </p>


            <blockquote>
                Though there is a lot of
                talk about the new and fertile foundation
                that Descartes, Galileo,
                and Newton introduced and used in their research,
                such a foundation
                cannot be found in practice...
                we now have a fundamentalist
                epistemology and entirely separate practice of
                research in philosophy of nature and science.
                This antagonism and the related
                irrationality of modern science is
                hidden by a slanted method of representation,
                which depicts even the most revolutionary
                discovery as resting on a solid foundation.
                (173-174)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                A common myth about the Scientific Revolution is that it
                represented a turn from ungrounded speculation to theory based
                solidly upon facts. However, as Feyerabend notes, Galileo
                criticized Aristotle for relying too much 
                upon the experience, and
                paying insufficient attention to speculative reason! He quotes
                Galileo (from <i>On Motion</i>):
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                [Aristotle] asserted [his theory of motion]
                on the basis of no other reason than experience...
                But, to employ reasoning at all
                times rather than examples (for what 
                we seek are the causes of effects, and these causes are 
                not given to us by experience)... (182)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, what we have in the published product is
                a fairly complete work up through the pre-Socratics, but is
                much more abbreviated from that point on. Neverthless, we are
                offered tantalizing glimpses into Feyerabend's understanding of
                modern philosophy of science. He is clearly an admirer of
                Hegel's thought, especially his dynamical view of our concepts
                themselves, Hegel's effort to overcome the "rigidity of classical
                science" (186). His extensive quotations from Engels and
                Lenin in the section on Hegel illustrates, as a sidelight to
                his main points, how seriously Marxist thinkers studied Hegel.
            </p>

            <p>
                In his section on Newton, Leibniz and Mach, Feyerabend
                stretches back to analyze Leibniz and Berkeley as precursors of
                Mach's critique of the Newtonian worldview. He regards Berkeley
                as "the acute precursor of modern positivism," and considers
                his work "On Motion" as "a masterpiece" (193). He notes that
                Newton's physics required the continual intervention of God to
                stabilize the world, an understanding
                Leibniz and Descartes rejected. Mach was even more radical,
                insisting that "the mechanistic notion of nature had no
                foundation in experience and needed to be eliminated" (196).
            </p>

            <p>
                The final section dealing with modern philosophy of nature sees
                Einstein, Bohr, and Bohm as "signs of a new era" (197).
                The triumph of field theories, which do not sit easily in any
                mechanistic worldview, was the beginning of the end for
                mechanism. Einstein's theories rejected the absolute space and
                time of Newton, and understood space as relational and
                relative. Bohr was even more radical, and assigned "the subject
                a crucial role in the shaping of natural phenomena" (200).
                And for Bohr, as Feyerabend understands him, the dissolution of
                classical physics cannot be replaced by some new synthesis: "We
                have to be content with the <i>ruins</i> of the classic
                worldview" (201).
            </p>

            <p>
                Bohm (whom Feyerabend notes was deeply read in Hegel) and his
                allies represent a reaction to Bohr, given that they
                "deliberately placed the idea of an objective description of
                nature at the top of their preferences" (202), although in a
                manner hardly compatible with the mechanistic framework.
                Feyerabend clearly approves of these recent developments, since
                the mechanistic approach "pushed aside... a large number of
                obvious facts [such as the] independent existence of the
                soul [and] mental powers that are independent of matter" (203).
                He concludes by welcoming the onset of a "new
                philosophical and mythological science" (207)
                that will be more fully human than the mechanistic science
                it is replacing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The book then includes several letters that Feyerabend wrote,
                to colleagues and others interested in his plans, that shed
                some light on its main body. Curiously, at some
                points, these seem to contradict the primary text, for
                instance, when Feyerabend criticizes the views of "savages"
                (217). But that letter was written much earlier than the central
                text, and possibly his view evolved.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Feyerabend's research presented in this 
                volume provides us with a fascinating insight into the 
                serious historical contemplation
                that lay behind his "anarchic" methodological stance.
                One need not accept all of Feyerabend's
                conclusion to appreciate that he was correct 
                in noting that, despite all of the scientific wonders
                the new view of nature has brought us, important aspects of
                human experience were marginalized in the course of its rise to
                dominance.
