        In this essay I want to draw attention to a period in the history
        of science that, I believe, will be of interest to supporters of
        Austrian economics. The episode in question is almost unknown
        to those only familiar with the accounts of scientific history
        found in works intended for the general public or in science
        textbooks, because it doesn't fit into the storyline such narratives
        almost invariably are intended to convey.

        Murray Rothbard called that common tale the
        "Whig history of science," but it also might be termed
        the Voltarian or the Enlightenment history of science. 
        It was spun in the wake of the triumph of Newtonian mechanics
        during the 18th century, by intellectuals eager to inspire
        reverence for the new natural philosophy they admired and to
        discredit the Catholic Church they despised. According to
        their account, after the decline of ancient Greek civilization,
        science had sunk from view beneath the dogmatism and superstition
        of the time they tendentiously called "The Middle Ages."
        (See Grant, 1996, for a debunking of this view.)

        Only with the work of Copernicus, in the 16th
        century, did the light of reason again begin to shine
        through those clouds of ignorance. At the turn of
        the 17th century the clouds were further parted by
        Galileo and Kepler, and several decades later they
        were finally burned away completely by the brilliance
        of Newton. Once science had been liberated from the
        shackles of faith, its progress was steady and irresistible.
        The problem is that, in order to tell the story they
        wished to promote, the tellers had to edit out large
        portions of the actual history of science. One of
        the significant omissions is the fact that what was
        called "the mechanical philosophy" dominated science
        during most of the 17th century.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important for our purposes to understand
        that the mechanical philosophy, whose adherents
        included Descartes, Gassendi, Boyle, Hobbes, and other
        major thinkers, was put forward as a progressive program,
        seeking to banish "occult explanations" from acceptable
        scientific discourse. Although it took on somewhat different
        forms in the writings of its various proponents, it can
        be summarized, without too much distortion, as
        asserting that only the extension, place, and
        motion of bits of matter are valid components of
        a truly scientific explanation (Westfall, 1977, p. 31).
        The mechanical philosophers held that "bodies comprise
        only particles of matter in motion," where matter is
        forbidden from having any active principles (Westfall, 1977, p. 33).
        Or, to directly quote Descartes, who was perhaps the foremost
        promoter of the approach under discussion, "I considered in
        general all the clear and distinct notions which our understanding
        can contain with regard to material things. And I found
        no others except for the notions we have of shapes,
        sizes and motions . . ." (quoted in Sargent, 1995, p. 32).
      </p>  

      <p>
        A notable aspect of the mechanical philosophy,
        especially for our purposes, was its adherents obsession
        with creating models that could account for observed
        phenomena employing only the size, shape, and motion of
        material particles. Little was done in the way of ascertaining
        whether the models were realistic; the important thing was
        to have a model. For instance, magnetism was a thorny issue
        for these thinkers, since the most obvious explanation of
        magnetic attraction involved the occult and unacceptable notion
        of an attractive force. Descartes devised a suitably mechanical
        model attempting to account for magnetic attraction, one in
        which the Earth and other magnetic bodies emitted streams
        of little screw-shaped particles, which, when they passed
        through the pores of any iron object, drew that object
        towards the magnet. (See the image of Descartes' model
        at the top of this page, which is from the cover of Westfall, 1977.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Along the same lines, "In De Corpore [Thomas] Hobbes
        had presented a mechanical explanation of the production
        of cold and ice, both of which he attributed to a 'constant wind'
        that pressed upon bodies." A liquid freezes when
        that wind "raises the parts of it in such a way that
        the uppermost parts become pressed together and thus
        'coagulated'" (Sargent, 1995, pp. 202â€“03). And Robert Boyle
        and Robert Hooke explained the relationship they had discovered,
        between the volume of a certain amount of air and the
        pressure to which it was subjected, by "the supposition
        that air consists of particles like little coiledsprings,
        like wool, which 'consists of many slender and flexible hairs; e
        ach of which may indeed, like a little spring, be easily
        bent and rolled up, but will also, like a spring,
        be still endeavouring to stretch itself out again'" 
        (Pyle, 1995, p. 476). Such models seem absurd to us today. 
        But it is important to realize that, at the time they were put
        forward, they were seen as the cutting edge of science, 
        replacing the primitive and unscientific explanations
        of natural phenomena that had been offered by Aristotle and his disciples.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Even in physics, where the mechanical philosophy
        was most successful, dogmatic adherence to its precepts
        crippled research into certain topics. For example, as
        Westfall notes: "By the end of the 17th century, the
        mechanical philosophy, which encouraged optics early
        in the century, and which furnished the idiom in which
        all students of optics . . . discussed the science,
        had become an obstacle to further progress. . . .
        [O]ptics stagnated for a century" (1977, p. 64).
      </p>

      <p>
        In other sciences the effect of its supremacy were
        even more deleterious. Westfall describes "the story
        of chemistry in the second half of the [17th] century
        [as] the story . . . of its subjection to the mechanical
        philosophy, since the growing role of mechanisms in chemical
        literature appears less to have sprung from the phenomena
        than to have been imposed on them by external considerations"
        (1977, p. 69). Similar to the way in which model building in
        modern economics has been used to justify every conceivable
        policy prescription, Westfall notes: "The mechanical philosophy
        did not in itself offer a chemical theory. On the contrary,
        it was potentially adaptable to almost any theory" (1977, p. 71).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Rather than searching for the fundamental causal
        factors underlying the multiplicity of chemical phenomena,
        the focus of the mechanical philosophers was on devising some
        model, any model, that appeared to explain each particular
        phenomenon with which they were presented using only mechanical
        elements. Westfall comments, "Like his fellow mechanical chemists,
        [Lemery, the leading French chemist of the 17th century,] seemed
        possessed by a mania to explain every property and every phenomenon"
        (1977, p. 73). He contends, "In no area of science was the tendency
        to imagine invisible mechanisms carried to such extremes" as it
        was in chemistry (1977, p. 81). For example, Lemery's theory
        of why acids dissolved metals suggested that the particles making
        up acids had little, dagger-like points, points which skewered
        the smooth particles composing metals and then carried them away
        from their comrades. Metals could be precipitated back out of a
        solution by adding another substance whose particles moved
        in such an agitated fashion that they would break off the
        points of the particles of acid, thus setting the particles
        of metal free.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most prominent, and arguably the best, chemist
        of the 17th century was Robert Boyle. Although he was
        not as dogmatic as many other proponents of the mechanical
        philosophy, it was still the case that "the development of a
        satisfactory chemical theory as such was not Boyle's goal.
        Chemistry represented to him a means to demonstrate the validity
        of the mechanical philosophy of nature" (Westfall, 1977, p. 77). 
        Indeed, "his mechanical philosophy appears to have operated
        to thwart the most promising aspect of his chemistry" (Westfall, 1977, p. 79).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Westfall concludes his discussion of mechanical chemistry
        by saying: "Since there were no criteria by which to judge
        the superiority of one imagined mechanism over another,
        the mechanical philosophy itself dissolved into
        as many versions as there were chemists. . . .
        It is difficult to see that the mechanical philosophy
        contributed anything to the progress of chemistry
        as a science" (p. 81).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The reign of the mechanical philosophy had a similar
        effect on the advancement of biology. One of the
        most significant biological discoveries of the era,
        that the heart is a pump serving to circulate blood
        throughout the body, was made not by a mechanical philosopher
        but by an animist, William Harvey. (Descartes, instead,
        explained the heart as a heat engine that expanded the blood,
        forcing it out through the circulatory system.) 
        The mechanists, when confronted with the discovery
        of mammalian eggs by investigators employing the
        microscope, and unable to accept the existence of
        anything such as a "formative virtue" that could
        transform some simple substance into a complex body,
        responded with the theory that a fully formed animal was 
        contained inside every egg. Of course, if the little critter
        in the egg was a female, she would already have eggs in her,
        within which would be her fully formed children, who would 
        contain eggs containing their children. . . . It even was
        suggested "that the entire human race was present already
        in Eve" (Westfall, 1977, p. 100).

      <p>
        In arriving at such theories, the mechanical
        philosophers had not engaged in any deep
        contemplation of biology, as a result of which
        they concluded that their method offered the best
        approach for examining living creatures. They had
        already decided that only mechanical explanations
        could qualify as scientific, and so they tried to
        force fit biological processes into their moulds. As
        Westfall puts it, "[Mechanistic biology] did not arise
        from the demands of biological study; it was far more the
        puppet regime set up by the mechanical philosophy's invasion"
        (1977, p. 104).
      </p>

      <p>
        The mechanical philosophy lost its hold on
        the scientific imagination during the 18th century,
        due both to the unsatisfactory nature of many of the
        explanations it offered, and to the stellar success of
        Newton's distinctly non-mechanical theory of gravity. 
        It is worth noting that in many cases, science advanced
        by going "backwards" to concepts that had been rejected
        by the mechanical philosophers as "unscientific." As I just
        noted, Newton's theory of gravity did not meet the mechanical
        criteria for a proper scientific theoryâ€”per Newton, one body was
        somehow able to influence another body without any physical
        contact between the twoâ€”and when it was published, it was widely
        derided by Cartesians as a throwback to the positing of
        "occult forces" characteristic of the superstitious views
        of Renaissance naturalism. Similarly, Newton attributed 
        his mathematical advances to revisiting the works of the
        ancient Greek geometers, and dismissed the recently
        developed Cartesian geometry as "the Analysis of the 
        Bunglers in Mathematicks" (Westfall, 1980, p. 379â€“80).
        Furthermore, some theories developed during the reign
        of mechanical philosophy, that were long rejected as
        hopelessly flawed, eventually underwent resuscitation.
        Again turning to Newton for an example, his idea that
        all material bodies are composed of only a very few 
        elementary particles, and that what appear to be chemical
        elements are really compounds of those building blocks, and,
        therefore, could be transformed into each other, was seen
        as an unsightly blemish on his great career for two
        centuries. However, as Pyle notes:
      </p>

      <p>
        This criticism seems unfair and unwarranted.
        In the first place, the Newtonian matter-theory is 
        remarkably close to what we now believe to be the truth.
        Chemical species do only arise at a 'molecular' level, i.e.
        as a result of the aggregation of simpler (and chemical neutral)
        constituents. The chemical atom of Dalton is a highly complex
        structure, made up of neutrons, protons, electrons, etc.,
        held together by powerful interparticulate forces of various
        kinds. The transmutation of the so-called 'chemical elements'
        is physically possible although, as Newton foresaw, highly
        difficult owing to the strength of those forces (1995, p. 433).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Although the mechanical philosophy is
        long dead and buried, our age is not without
        its own dogma regarding properly scientific explanations.
        Today, the prevailing belief is that any real science must 
        be composed of mathematical models, models which yield quantitative
        predictions about some class of events based on particular, initial 
        conditions, also specified numerically. Once again, the currently popular
        methodology has been imposed on diverse disciplines with little regard to 
        whether it is suitable to their subject matter, but simply because it
        is thought to be the only respectable way to do science. The 
        philosopher John DuprÃ© calls this "scientific imperialism,"
        meaning "the tendency for a successful scientific idea to be 
        applied far beyond its original home, and generally with 
        decreasing success the more its application is expanded" (2001, p. 16).
        Once again, we see a frantic effort to generate models
        fitting the accepted paradigm, with little regard 
        for the realism of the assumptions and mechanisms from
        which they are constructed.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, the relevance of the history
        of the mechanical philosophy to the circumstances
        with which Austrian economists currently struggle should
        be apparent. It illustrates a number of points that can be
        used to defend their embrace of an unfashionable view of
        economics:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It is not the case that science always makes
        steady progress; it sometimes enters cul-de-sacs that
        it must eventually back out of in order to move forward again.
        That is especially the case when a methodology from one
        science is imposed on another without concern for its aptness
        in the new domain.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It is not the case that <a href ="http://www.mail-archive.com/armchair@gmu.edu/msg01215.html"> 
        scientific truth can be decided by a "market test"</a>;
        science is not toothpaste, and markets cater to the
        preferences of participants, without
        regard to whether those preferences arise from scrupulous
        examination or ill-considered prejudice.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It is not the case that <a href= "http://crookedtimber.org/2004/01/31/economists-and-society"> a real science must forget
        its founders</a>; often, the key needed to unlock some
        gate barring the way forward can be found in the ideas
        of a long-dead thinker.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And it is not the case that <a href= "http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/whyaust.htm"> scientists should placidly
        drift with the prevalent methodological tide </a> like
        so many jellyfish bobbing in the waves; the greatest
        scientists have often been the ones who had the courage
        to swim against the current.
