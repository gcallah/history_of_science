            "When it comes to narratives, the brain seems to be the last province 
            of the theoretician-charlatan. Add neurosomething to a field, and suddenly 
            it rises in respectability and becomes more convincing as people now have 
            the illusion of a strong causal link..." -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb,

            The Grey Lady Grows Senile

        <p>
        I flipped through the week in review section of the New York Times
        while attending to some other, serious business  
        in the bathroom. Thomas Friedman was comparing ISIS to kudzu. 
        The metaphor may be mildly enlightening, but Friedmans  
        attempts to draw policy conclusions from it just seemed silly. 
        Nicholas Kristof, who appears to be pretty darned       
        white, is complaining about how "White people don't get it."
        Maureen Dowd is writing something about some female   
        comic book character. In short, the usual middlebrow tedium.
        <br>
        <br>

        And then I found this, a piece questioning whether 
        humans are actually conscious! This was a dive from middlebrow 
        tedium into the utter depths of stupidity! And you know how utter
        stupidity is the La Brea Tar Pit of Callahan, so      
        let's wade in! The piece begins:
        <br>
        <br>

        "OF the three most fundamental scientific questions
        about the human condition, two have been answered."
        <br>
        <br>

        What Graziano is actually going to ask are three
        philosophical questions, but he does not even know enough about
        philosophy to realize this. And what are they?
        <br>
        <br>

        "First, what is our relationship to the rest of the universe?
        Copernicus answered that one. We're not at the center.  
        We're a speck in a large place."
        <br>
        <br>

        So we have here the usual ahistorical nonsense about the 
        meaning of Copernicus. As if the question "What is our 
        relationship to the rest of the universe?" can be answered 
        by locating us physically in space! I wonder, if asked  
        about his relationship with his significant other, Dr. Graziano
        answers, "I am often to the left of her, but   
        sometimes move around to her right." On to number two:
        <br>
        <br>

        "Second, what is our relationship to the diversity of life?
        Darwin answered that one. Biologically speaking, we’re 
        not a special act of creation. We’re a twig on the tree
        of evolution."
        <br>
        <br>

        Once again, by mistaking a philosophical question for a
        scientific one, Graziano offers a ridiculous non-answer: a 
        fact about the historical origins of the human species
        is simply not up to answering the question, "Is human life 
        special in some way?" Alexander, Buddha, Aristotle, Newton, 
        and Napoleon all emerged from wombs, but this just         
        doesn't get anywhere on the question of "Are these people
        special?" You can't refute someone who claims "America has 
        a unique role in history" by noting that all Americans
        are descended from hunter-gatherers.
        <br>
        <br>

        But let's move on to the real gem of the piece;
        regarding the relationship between mind and the physical world, 
        Graziano contends: "I believe a major change in our perspective
        on consciousness may be necessary, a shift from a 
        credulous and egocentric viewpoint to a skeptical
        and slightly disconcerting one: namely, that we don't
        actually have inner feelings in the way most
        of us think we do."
        <br>
        <br>

        Um, Dr. Graziano, if we are not really conscious, and we have
        no "inner feelings," then we have no "viewpoint" to   
        shift from either, "credulous and egocentric" or not.
        <br>
        <br>

        From there, Graziano continues with some of the worst
        hand-waving nonsense I have encountered in quite some time:     
        "The brain has arrived at a conclusion that is not correct. 
        When we introspect and seem to find that ghostly thing --  
        awareness, consciousness, the way green looks or pain 
        feels -- our cognitive machinery is accessing internal models 
        and those models are providing information that is wrong.
        ["Providing it" to whom?] The machinery is computing an       
        elaborate story about a magical-seeming property. 
        [Who is being told this "story"?] And there is no way
        for the brain to determine through introspection
        that the story is wrong, because introspection 
        always accesses the same incorrect information."
        <br>
        <br>

        How in the world can this explain the fact that,
        say, I actually see green leaves outside my window 
        right now?! And if somehow some meaning can
        be attached to the idea that I don't actually
        see them and this is just a mistake my 
        brain is making... Well, then, we'd better throw Graziano's
        earlier "answers" to the first two of the three important    
        questions right out the window, because the theories of 
        Copernicus and Darwin relied entirely on things that their   
        brains were mistakenly concluding that they were observing. 
        And all of the neuroscience that Graziano claims to be     
        drawing on to reach his conclusions? All of that was developed
        by neuroscientists based upon things their brains were      
        tricking them into thinking they were looking at. In fact, 
        the very idea that we have a brain is based upon the         
        mistaken idea that when we cut open a human head, we actually 
        see a brain in there, since, according to Graziano, we     
        are mistaken about having been conscious of seeing anything at all.
        <br>
        <br>

        The basic problem Graziano hasn't faced up to is this:
        if I can be mistaken about the fact that I feel an itch right  
        at this moment, then there is nothing whatsoever that I can't
        be mistaken about, including every single observation      
        upon which all of science is based. So Graziano's "theory"
        entirely undermines every bit of the science which      
        supposedly requires it in the first place.
        <br>
        <br>

        When Daniel Dennett declared consciousness to be an "illusion,"
        someone said this was the worst philosophical           
        position that had ever been put forward, as it is instantly self-refuting. 
        But Graziano is going to double-down on           
        this bad bet with a load of gibberish. And the NY Times published it!
