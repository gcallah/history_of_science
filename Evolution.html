        <h4>
            What does evolution tell us about the value of human beings?
        </h4>
        <p>
                Nothing, of course,  but some people seem desperately to want to believe
                otherwise.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                The theory of evolution is a fine scientific theory. It is a very good
                explanation of the historical process by which the current diversity of species
                came to exist on the earth. But, of course, as a scientific theory, it
                addresses the phenomenal level of existence; it has nothing to say about the
                substantial level whatsoever.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                What Bob rightly objects to in this post is people who want to take a valid
                scientific theory and extend it to realms in which it has no applicability,
                such as metaphysics or ethics. It is as though, upon seeing a wonderful new
                plumbing fixture, someone concludes, "You see! I told you homosexuality is a
                sin!" Or encountering an innovative lightbulb, they exclaim, "It is as I
                thought: the universe is an indifferent place, devoid of meaning."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                A particularly startling claim was made in the comment thread to Bob's post,
                and found some backing there. "Evolution," this line runs, "may not have proved
                there is no God; but it has certainly shown that humankind has no unique role
                in the living world."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                This line of reasoning is so preposterous that, as I mentioned above,
                desperation is the only explanation for why someone might adopt it. Let us look
                at some similar "debunkings" of uniqueness claims based on identical reasoning:
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Leonardo: The Mona Lisa is unique among my paintings in its excellence!
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Debunker: No way: you painted it with a brush on a canvas, just like almost
                every other painting.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Sports analyst: LeBron James is a uniquely talented basketball player.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Debunker: Uh-uh: He was born from the union of the sperm and egg of two human
                beings, just like every other basketball player.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Automobile writer: The Lamborghini is unique among cars.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Debunker: What an idiot! Don't you know that the "Theory of Factory
                Manufacturing" forever discredited the idea of some uniquely great car?
                <br>
                <br>
                
                There you have the entirety of this "idea": if the mechanical means by which X
                was brought about is very similar to how Y was brought about, then X can't have
                any special quality or value that Y doesn't have!
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Once you really analyze what is being said, it is so shockingly silly that a
                truly monumental will to believe (in reductionist materialism, in this case)
                must be behind its being said at all.

                Evolution and Design

            <p>
            Kevin Vallier generated a hailstorm of comments by posting the following on Facebook:
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
            <b>Hypothesis</b>:
            <br>
            Darwinism does not significantly alter the 
            force of the design argument for God's existence.
            <br>
            If it was weak before Darwin, it was weak after Darwin.
            <br>
            If it was strong before Darwin, it was strong after Darwin."
            </blockquote> 

            <p>
            
            Kevin is surely correct here.
            <br>
            <br>
            One way to see this is to reverse the situation:
            <br>
            <br>
            If we tomorrow were to see animals simply popping into existence out of nowhere,
            would (and should) this convince any atheists that God exists? No:
            it would simply be held that somehow nature is such that animals pop 
            into existence out of nowhere, and a "naturalistic" theory of 
            how they do so would be developed.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Or think of this:
            <br>
            <br>
            If you believe Rembrandt painted a particular 
            picture hanging in your hallway, would this belief be 
            weakened if someone told you, "No, the reason that paint clings to 
            that canvas can easily be explained by the 
            chemical properties of the canvas"? Showing that something came 
            about through a physio-chemical process has no bearing 
            on the question of whether or not it was designed.
            <br>
            <br>
            It might have implications about who the designer could be:
            if it appeared beyond the physical capacities of 
            the posited designer to manipulate the process in question, 
            then we could conclude that, whether or not the item 
            under examination was designed, that was not the designer! 
            For example, if someone says to you, "All life on earth 
            was designed by slugs," it's fair to point out that this 
            doesn't seem to be the sort of thing of which slugs are capable.
            But of course, faced with someone who believes
            "An all-powerful being used the process of evolution to
            generate the creatures he wished to have populate his world,"
            to respond "Nah, that would be beyond such a being's capabilities"
            seems silly.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Another telling example:
            <br>
            <br>
            Last night [at the I wrote this] against the Thunder,
            Miami's Shane Battier banked in a three-point shot.
            I can picture a Heat and a Thunder fan sitting together watching the game.
            The Thunder fan screams, "What a lucky shot!"
            The Heat fan claims, "No, he meant to bank that."
            So the Heat fan is claiming design, and the Thunder fan chance.
            The Thunder fan might present various arguments backing his view,
            such as "Battier never banks his three-point shots,"
            or "Nobody tries to bank in a shot from there."
            But it is pretty clearly useless to his cause to say
            "There was no design involved:
            that shot followed the laws of physics the whole way!"

            <h4>
                Does Evolution Tell the Truth or Not?
            </h4>
                <p>
                    Attempts to formulate a naturalistic epistemology are often anchored by the
                    notion that undirected evolution would lead us naturally to have accurate
                    beliefs. Some people have doubted this approach works, 
                    but let's say it does.
                    It basically says that we perceive, say, tigers and lions as a threat to us
                    because, well, they are a threat to us, and heights make us cautious because
                    falling from a great height will kill us, we think sex is good because sex
                    propagates the species, we seek out food 
                    because we really do need food, and so
                    on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
    
                    Isn't it odd, then, that went evidence turns 
                    up for an evolutionary basis for
                    religion, this approach is thrown right out the window,
                    and the ubiquity of
                    religion in human societies is explained by everything 
                    other than evolution
                    leading us to accurately perceive a 
                    spiritual dimension to life? It is almost
                    as though these researchers had had 
                    their minds made up about religion in
                    advance!

        <h4>
        Evolution Confusion
        </h4>
        
    		<p>
    			Let us consider a recent article on "The Myths of Evolution"
                from <em>The New Scientist</em>.
                Unfortunately, the article is full of the usual philosophical rubbish 
                put out in these pop-evolution pieces. As Eric Voegelin said, Darwinism 
                has provided a "new creed for the semi-educated."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Here are a few examples:
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Darwin presented compelling evidence for evolution in
                <em>On the Origin</em> and, since his time,
                the case has become overwhelming."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Kind of like the case for Newtonian physics in 1880, heh?
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Countless fossil discoveries allow us to trace the evolution 
                of today's organisms from earlier forms. DNA sequencing has confirmed 
                beyond any doubt that all living creatures share a common origin."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Fine. Neither of those statements has any bearing on 
                the truth of NeoDarwinian evolutionary models
                as opposed to other evolutionary models.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Innumerable examples of evolution in action can be seen all around us, 
                from the pollution-matching pepper moth to fast-changing viruses 
                such as HIV and H5N1 bird flu. Evolution is as firmly established a 
                scientific fact as the roundness of the Earth."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Once again, the authors are confusing (deliberately?) 
                the issues of "Do species evolve?" and 
                "Is NeoDarwinism the correct model of how they evolve?"
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "For those who have never had the opportunity to find out about 
                biology or science, claims made by those who believe in
                supernatural alternatives to evolutionary theory can
                appear convincing."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                And for those who have never had the opportunity to find out about
                philosophy, philosophical rubbish can appear convincing!
                So what about supernatural evolutionary theories 
                (such as those accepted by the Catholic Church, e.g., 
                evolution happened much as the Darwinists claim, 
                directed all the while by God)? And, in any case, 
                the whole distinction is fatuous, given that the 
                existence of nature itself is not susceptible 
                to anything other than a "supernatural" explanation.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Have the people who write this stuff taken even an 
                introductory course in the history or philosophy of science? 
                Have they ever heard of the Duhem-Quine thesis?

            Collingwood on the Vacuity of "Evolutionary Ethics"
            </h4>
            
    			<p>
                "The last theory we shall examine defines evil by 
                reference to the conception of evolution. Our sins,
                according to this theory, are the habits proper to 
                a past stage in the evolutionary process, lingering 
                on like rudimentary organs into our present life. 
                Here again there is a fact at the bottom of the 
                theory. It is true that the particular way in 
                which we go wrong is often explicable by reference 
                to past habits of which we have never entirely 
                got rid. But the question still remains unanswered 
                why we should go wrong at all. Nor is the theory 
                fully true even so far as it goes; for atavism 
                is not a crime, and just so far as our "crimes" 
                are really cases of atavism they are not culpable;
                unless indeed it is supposed that our evolution is
                entirely in our own hands. But if that is so, 
                morality must be called in to account for evolution,
                not vice versa.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "It is a striking fact that the biological conception
                of evolution has never yet produced anything but
                confusion when applied to philosophical questions.
                The reason seems to be that it gives, in the form in
                which it is commonly held, no answer to the one question
                with which philosophy is concerned. As we said in a former
                chapter, science (including the theory of evolution) is
                simply a description of behaviour, and advances no
                hypothesis as to why things behave as they do.
                The theory of evolution is a purely historical statement
                about the way in which life has developed; ethics is
                concerned with the force of will which lies behind
                all merely descriptive history. It makes little difference
                to the scientist whether he regards evolution as a purely
                mechanical process or as directed by the volition of
                conscious agents; but until this question is answered,
                evolution is simply irrelevant to ethics.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "In this case, for instance, there are three conceivable
                hypotheses, [any] of which might be adopted by science
                without greatly altering its particular problems; but
                for ethics they are poles asunder. (i.) If the process
                is really mechanical, the habits may be explained,
                but they are not sins, [If (i) is held, as is usually
                the case, then "evolutionary ethics" actually is not
                a theory of ethics, but a theory as to why there is
                no such thing as ethics.] (ii.) If a central mind such
                as that of God directs the process, then the habits in
                question are not our sins but God's. (iii.) If, as above
                suggested, the process is in the hands of the evolving
                species, the bad or superseded habits are sinful, but
                they are not explained. Thus the evolutionary view of
                the question only restates the problem in terms which
                conceal the fact that no solution is offered."

                The fact that ideas refuted a century ago are today put

            <h4>
            T. H. Green on evolutionary ethics
            </h4>
            <p>
            "In Hume's time a philosopher who denied the 
            innateness of moral sentiments, and held 
            that they must have a natural history, had 
            only the limits of the individual life 
            within which to trace this history.
            These limits did not give room enough for even a 
            plausible derivation of moral interests from animal wants.
            It is otherwise when the history may be 
            supposed to range over an indefinite number of generations.
            The doctrine of hereditary transmission, it is held, 
            explains to us how susceptibilities of pleasure and pain,
             of desire and aversion, of hope and fear, 
            may be handed down with gradually accumulated 
            modifications which in time attain the 
            full measure of the difference 
            between the moral man and the greater ape...
            <br>
            <br>
            
            "...the theory of descent and evolution opens 
            up a vista of possibilities beyond the facts,
            so far ascertained, of human history...
            Such enquiry, it is thought, will in time 
            give us the means of reducing the moral 
            susceptibilities of man to the rank of 
            ordinary physical facts, parts of one system,
             and intelligible by the same methods, with 
            all the natural phenomena which we are learning to know...
            <br>
            <br>
            
            "It has generally been expected of a moralist, 
            however, that he should explain not only how 
            men do act, but how they should act: and 
            as a matter of fact we find that those who 
            regard the process of man's natural development 
            most strictly as a merely natural one are as 
            forward as any to propound rules of living,
             to which they conceive that, according to their 
            view of the influences which make him what he is, man ought to conform.
            The natural science of man is to them the basis of a practical art…
            <br>
            <br>
            
            "Now it is obvious that to a being who is simply 
            a result of natural forces an injunction to conform to their laws is unmeaning.
            A philosopher, then, who would reconstruct our 
            ethical systems in conformity with the doctrines of evolution and descent...
            if he has the courage of his principles, having 
            reduced the speculative part of them to a natural science...
            must abolish the practical or preceptive part altogether...
            <br>
            <br>
            
            "[This theory] logically carries with it the conclusion,
            however the conclusion may be disguised, that, 
            in inciting ourselves or others to do anything 
            because it ought to be done, we are at best 
            making use of a serviceable illusion."

            <br>
            <br>
            
            The above was published in 1883.
            <br>
            <br>
            What is interesting to me in the passage is:
            <br>
            <br>
            
            1) Evolutionary ethics had already been propounded 
            by 1883 in a form very close to the one it has today.
            It is not some new discovery of the sociobiologists 
            of the 1970s or the later evolutionary ethicists of the present day.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            2) Idealists such as Green (and Bosanquet and 
            Collingwood and Oakshott) understood the theory 
            perfectly well, and even acknowledged its 
            genuine achievements in partly explaining how we 
            have come to have the ethics we do have.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            3) The chief problem with the theory was already well understood:
            while it might explain, in whole or in part, why we do behave the 
            way we do, it cannot possibly recommend how we ought to behave,
            and fact renders such recommendations otiose: they are like 
            recommending to amoebas that they stop reproducing 
            asexually and get on with having sex like us more advanced beings.
            Genghis Khan was every bit as much a product of evolution as St.
            Francis of Assisi, and was, in fact,
            fantastically more successful at passing on his genes.
            It is hard to see how something calling itself 
            "evolutionary ethics" could argue, with a straight face, 
            that capturing women and using them as sexual slaves 
            is "wrong," so long as one is fairly certain to be able 
            to successfully implement that strategy.
            (Of course, a society where every single male tried to 
            do this would not turn out too well, but if someone was 
            certain that he would be as successful as Khan, 
            how could the "evolutionary ethicist" 
            say anything other than "Help yourself!"?)

            There Is No Valid Route from "It Evolved" to "It Is Good"
            </h4>
            
                <p>
                One response from people who 
				want to reject moral realism 
                but still hold that, say, the view "slavery is A-OK" is wrong 
                and our current view is correct is to say something like, 
                "Well, this is part of an evolutionary process."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                If what they mean by this is, "This shift is part of a 
                spiritual learning process by which humanity comes closer 
                to understanding objective moral reality," well, 
                that concedes my point.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                On the other hand, if they are thinking in terms of 
                Darwinian evolution, the argument goes nowhere. 
                It embodies the vulgar Darwinism that equates "evolution" 
                with "progress," a mapping Darwinism properly understood 
                forbids. It recalls that Darwinian evolution involves 
                "survival of the fittest," but forgets that it 
                also involves "wiping out of the not fittest."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                The species living on earth today represent perhaps 
                .1% of all species that have ever existed. So, 99.9% 
                of what evolved "failed"! For every one evolutionary 
                "progression" that survives today, a thousand didn't 
                make it... and that doesn't even count all of the 
                random mutations that never produced a distinct 
                species. 99.9% of species turned out to be 
                evolutionary dead ends.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                If one takes a "naturalistic" view of evolution, 
                it is completely invalid to move from "Y evolved from X" 
                to "therefore, Y represents progress over X." 
                The tyrannical, late Roman Empire "evolved" from the 
                Roman Republic, after all: do these naive believers 
                in progress wish to insist that it was therefore better?
                <br>
                <br>
                
                And note: most often, the entire idea of "progressive" 
                politics relies on this nonsensical conflation 
                of evolution and progress.

            <h4>
            It's the Same Old DeWrong, with a Different Beat Since Reason's Been Gone
            </h4>
            
            <p>
             It is always fascinating when one can detect an irrational obsession in
             an otherwise smart person. I have no doubt Brad DeLong is smart. But
             when it comes to any questioning of reductionist materialist dogma,
             DeLong just loses it. For instance, in "responding" to Steve Landsburg,
             he starts a post off as follows:
             <br>
             <br>
            
             "Someone who claims to be a 'friend' makes me aware that others are 
             joining Alvin Plantzinga and Gene Callahan on the side of Thomas Nagel's
             creationists..." (Is 'friend' perhaps in quotes here because DeLong 
             has no friends and knows this person must be making the claim up?
             Hahaha, just kidding, Brad, I'm sure you have at least one friend!)
             <br>
             <br>
            
             Here, we have hit upon the Paretian "residue" that drives DeLong's
             irrational rants: he hates creationists. Now, Nagel is not
             a creationist, I am not a creationist, and Landsburg is not
             a creationist, but DeLong is afraid, very, very afraid, that
             some creationists might like some of the things we say! So what
             we say must be stamped out at all cost, even at the cost of 
             spouting nonsense, making up arguments and putting them in one's
             opponents mouth, and random name-calling with no regard to when
             the name applies and when it doesn't.
             <br>
             <br>
            
             The title of DeLong's post is: "THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
             OUR MINDS ARE TOO POWERFUL TO BE THE RESULT OF PURELY DARWINIAN
             PROCESSES." Yeah, why all caps? I don't know. But who has made
             any claim about the "power" of our minds? Nagel? No. Me? No. 
             Landsburg? No. DeLong has simply invented this out of whole cloth!
             The real issue, as far as I understand Nagel, and certainly as
             I would put it, is "Why should evolution, understood in purely
             Darwinian terms, have spawned organisms that are conscious and
             can reason, instead of just spawning automatons that can survive
             without thought?" I am not saying that this question is not 
             answerable by strict Darwinians (perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't);
             no, I am just saying that DeLong has totally missed the point:
             it is not a question of "power," but quite the opposite:
             if, as you reductionists insist, mere mechanisms thoughtlessly
             implementing algorithms can evolve so as to continually enhance
             their own survival, what the heck is the evolutionary point of
             making them all worried and neurotic by developing 
             consciousness in them? Now, Darwinists may or may not be able
             to give an adequate answer to that question; that is not what
             I wish to discuss here. No, my point is that DeLong has 
            not even engaged with the real question at all.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Nagel (as I understand his argument from reviews, not having 
            read the book) is claiming that, while Darwinian evolution may 
            account quite well for a lot of what we find in life, it is 
            incomplete. Well, isn't that exactly what the scientific 
            attitude towards all of our scientific theories is supposed to be? 
            They are all provisional, and all will be supplanted by 
            better theories one day? (For the record, I regard Darwin's 
            theory as one of the greatest achievements of science. In fact, 
            with my daughter, who appears to be very adept at biological 
            reasoning, I often present her with little challenges: 
            "Emma, think about this trait: how would you account for 
            it in terms of evolution?" She typically then uses her 
            knowledge of evolution and her reason to devise a very nice
            answer.)
            <br>
            <br>
            
            So who is being "unscientific" here: Nagel, who acknowledges 
            the genuine achievements of this theory but notes it leaves 
            some things unexplained, or the "evolutiomentalists," 
            who dogmatically insist that, "No, if you doubt the total 
            and complete explanatory power of this theory for even 
            a moment, you must be cast out as a heretic"?
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Finally, look at the rubbish DeLong launches at Landsburg: 
            because in the case of a neutron star, it is not true that 
            "The ratio π of the circumference of a circle to its 
            radius is such that 6.29 &gt; 2&pi; &gt; 6.28," 
            therefore Landsburg has 'self pwned.'"
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Oh my. How about this, DeWrong: "The closer any real 
            space comes to being Euclidean, the more closely will 
            <a href=""></a>
            the equation given above be accurate for relating 
            the circumference of a circle in that space to its radius."
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The above certainly seems to be a statement 
            about reality. Does DeLong really want to deny it?

        <h4>
            Survival of the Silliest
        </h4>

                <p>
                It's always surprising to me how someone 
                who keeps saying very silly things can
                find the stars align with his silliness, 
                and he's really big for a couple of
                years. Recent case in point: Matt Ridley.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Here Ridley tries to compare the role of 
                trade in "social evolution" to that of
                sex in biological evolution:
                </p>

                <blockquote> 
                The notion that exchange stimulated innovation by bringing together different
                ideas has a close parallel in biological evolution. The Darwinian process by
                which creatures change depends crucially on sexual reproduction, which brings
                together mutations from different lineages. Without sex, the best mutations
                defeat the second best, which then get lost to posterity. With sex, they come
                together and join the same team. So sex makes evolution a collective and
                cumulative process...
                </blockquote> 

                <p>
                Well, this is all very good. Or would be, if not for the facts that:
                <br>
                1) The "Darwinian process" cooked along fine for a couple of billion years
                without sexual reproduction, so it could hardly "depend crucially" upon it; and
                <br>
                2) In the Darwinian model, there is nothing to "accumulate" -- that implies a
                telos and some idea of progress, neither of which have any place in Darwin's
                model.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                So, once we take 1) and 2) into account, Ridley is just babbling
                pseudo-scientific rubbish, in order to give a scientific veneer to his ideas
                about trade.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                And then I came across this piece, in which Ridley tries to make a case that it
                really wasn't ideas that spawned the Industrial Revolution, but "material
                forces":
                </p>
                
                <blockquote> 
                As Gregory Clark has reminded us, it was only in the nineteenth century, when
                fossil fuels amplified human labor, that wages really began to rise. The rest
                of the world then borrowed this innovation -- fossil energy 
                -- and its ability to
                produce increasing returns through new technology.
                Today the average citizen of
                planet earth uses fossil energy equivalent to having 150 slaves working
                continuous eight-hour shifts on his or her behalf.
                That is why we are all so rich and that is 
                why per capita economic growth turned upwards so sharply after
                1800.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I say, a materialist explanation.

                on our planet before 1800, at which

                Say what?! The coal had always been there? 
                And what was new was the fact that
                people had developed the technology for 
                getting it out of the ground and making
                use of it? In other words, it was new

                In other words, an idealistic explanation.

                And by the way, what the heck does Ridley mean that the 150
                slaves are working "continuous eight-hour shifts"? If they are
                continuous, aren't they 24-hour shifts?

                Noah Millman, who typically seems to be an intelligent fellow, forwards two
                surprisingly fatuous contentions in this post
                (http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/ross-douthat-please-argue-with-better-atheists/).
                <br>
                <br>
                
                1) "we can’t rely naively on an Aristotelean teleology which we now know has no
                empirical basis"
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Ah, someone must've had their final-cause-detection meter set on high, and
                still have failed to find any teleology!
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Because what else can Millman mean here? Four hundred years ago, the founders
                of modern science made a methodological choice: they would only look for
                efficient causes, and they would only consider efficient causation in their
                explanations. Final causation was excluded not because of any evidence that it
                does not exist, but because explanations in terms of final causes were thought
                to be unenlightening.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                That an enterprise which has deliberately excluded teleology from its
                explanations does not reveal to us any final causes is hardly surprising.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                2) Millman next suggests that the hole created in Aristotelian ethics by
                removing teleology (which, on its face, would seem to be about the equivalent
                to the hole created in the United Kingdom by removing England, Scotland, Wales,
                and Northern Ireland) can be patched with the theory of evolution.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                This is absurd. The theory of evolution might help to explain why we act the
                way we do. But morality is about what we ought to do, not what we happen to
                actually do. Consider this: for the Romans, it was absolutely standard
                practice, after defeating an opponent in war, to grab all of the women of their
                foe and turn them into sex slaves. Quite obviously, there are a lot more people
                in the world with Roman genes because of this practice than there would've been
                otherwise. Or contemplate Genghis Khan*: I have read that something like a
                quarter of the population of Central Asia carries his genes.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Clearly, forcing women into sex with one "pays off" in evolutionary terms. And
                if we stick to a purely Darwinian perspective, there is nothing more to be
                said.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                In fact, a major role morality has played in history has been to get people to
                stop doing things that they evolved to do, even if those things offered an
                evolutionary advantage.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Thinking in terms of evolution can provide interesting insights into why we do
                the things we do. But quite obviously, it has nothing to say whatsoever about
                what we ought to do.
