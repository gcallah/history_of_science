            Kevin Vallier generated a hailstorm of comments by posting the following on Facebook:
            <br>
            <br>
            "<b>Hypothesis</b>:
            <br>
            Darwinism does not significantly alter the 
            force of the design argument for God's existence.
            <br>
            If it was weak before Darwin, it was weak after Darwin.
            <br>
            If it was strong before Darwin, it was strong after Darwin."

            Kevin is surely correct here.

            would (and should) this convince any atheists that God exists? No:
            it would simply be held that somehow nature is such that animals pop 
            into existence out of nowhere, and a "naturalistic" theory of 
            how they do so would be developed.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Or think of this:
            <br>
            <br>

            If you believe Rembrandt painted a particular 
            picture hanging in your hallway, would this belief be 
            weakened if someone told you, "No, the reason that paint clings to 
            that canvas can easily be explained by the 
            chemical properties of the canvas"? Showing that something came 
            about through a physio-chemical process has no bearing 
            on the question of whether or not it was designed.
            <br>
            <br>

            It might have implications about who the designer could be:
            if it appeared beyond the physical capacities of 
            the posited designer to manipulate the process in question, 
            then we could conclude that, whether or not the item 
            under examination was designed, that was not the designer! 
            For example, if someone says to you, "All life on earth 
            was designed by slugs," it's fair to point out that this 
            doesn't seem to be the sort of thing of which slugs are capable.
            But of course, faced with someone who believes
            "An all-powerful being used the process of evolution to
            generate the creatures he wished to have populate his world,"
            to respond "Nah, that would be beyond such a being's capabilities"
            seems silly.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Another telling example:
            <br>
            <br>

            Last night [at the I wrote this] against the Thunder,
            Miami's Shane Battier banked in a three-point shot.
            I can picture a Heat and a Thunder fan sitting together watching the game.
            The Thunder fan screams, "What a lucky shot!"
            The Heat fan claims, "No, he meant to bank that."
            So the Heat fan is claiming design, and the Thunder fan chance.
            The Thunder fan might present various arguments backing his view,
            such as "Battier never banks his three-point shots,"
            or "Nobody tries to bank in a shot from there."
            But it is pretty clearly useless to his cause to say
            "There was no design involved:
            that shot followed the laws of physics the whole way!"

>>>>>>> 354a8a5893c2b335f59c51f6978d71723434d008
                from <em>The New Scientist</em>.
                Unfortunately, the article is full of the usual philosophical rubbish 
                put out in these pop-evolution pieces. As Eric Voegelin said, Darwinism 
                has provided a "new creed for the semi-educated."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Here are a few examples:
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Darwin presented compelling evidence for evolution in
                <em>On the Origin</em> and, since his time,
                the case has become overwhelming."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Kind of like the case for Newtonian physics in 1880, heh?
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Countless fossil discoveries allow us to trace the evolution 
                of today's organisms from earlier forms. DNA sequencing has confirmed 
                beyond any doubt that all living creatures share a common origin."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Fine. Neither of those statements has any bearing on 
                the truth of NeoDarwinian evolutionary models
                as opposed to other evolutionary models.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Innumerable examples of evolution in action can be seen all around us, 
                from the pollution-matching pepper moth to fast-changing viruses 
                such as HIV and H5N1 bird flu. Evolution is as firmly established a 
                scientific fact as the roundness of the Earth."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Once again, the authors are confusing (deliberately?) 
                the issues of "Do species evolve?" and 
                "Is NeoDarwinism the correct model of how they evolve?"
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "For those who have never had the opportunity to find out about 
                biology or science, claims made by those who believe in
                supernatural alternatives to evolutionary theory can
                appear convincing."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                And for those who have never had the opportunity to find out about
                philosophy, philosophical rubbish can appear convincing!
                So what about supernatural evolutionary theories 
                (such as those accepted by the Catholic Church, e.g., 
                evolution happened much as the Darwinists claim, 
                directed all the while by God)? And, in any case, 
                the whole distinction is fatuous, given that the 
                existence of nature itself is not susceptible 
                to anything other than a "supernatural" explanation.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Have the people who write this stuff taken even an 
                introductory course in the history or philosophy of science? 
                Have they ever heard of the Duhem-Quine thesis?

                "The last theory we shall examine defines evil by 
                reference to the conception of evolution. Our sins,
                according to this theory, are the habits proper to 
                a past stage in the evolutionary process, lingering 
                on like rudimentary organs into our present life. 
                Here again there is a fact at the bottom of the 
                theory. It is true that the particular way in 
                which we go wrong is often explicable by reference 
                to past habits of which we have never entirely 
                got rid. But the question still remains unanswered 
                why we should go wrong at all. Nor is the theory 
                fully true even so far as it goes; for atavism 
                is not a crime, and just so far as our "crimes" 
                are really cases of atavism they are not culpable;
                unless indeed it is supposed that our evolution is
                entirely in our own hands. But if that is so, 
                morality must be called in to account for evolution,
                not vice versa.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "It is a striking fact that the biological conception
                of evolution has never yet produced anything but
                confusion when applied to philosophical questions.
                The reason seems to be that it gives, in the form in
                which it is commonly held, no answer to the one question
                with which philosophy is concerned. As we said in a former
                chapter, science (including the theory of evolution) is
                simply a description of behaviour, and advances no
                hypothesis as to why things behave as they do.
                The theory of evolution is a purely historical statement
                about the way in which life has developed; ethics is
                concerned with the force of will which lies behind
                all merely descriptive history. It makes little difference
                to the scientist whether he regards evolution as a purely
                mechanical process or as directed by the volition of
                conscious agents; but until this question is answered,
                evolution is simply irrelevant to ethics.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "In this case, for instance, there are three conceivable
                hypotheses, [any] of which might be adopted by science
                without greatly altering its particular problems; but
                for ethics they are poles asunder. (i.) If the process
                is really mechanical, the habits may be explained,
                but they are not sins, [If (i) is held, as is usually
                the case, then "evolutionary ethics" actually is not
                a theory of ethics, but a theory as to why there is
                no such thing as ethics.] (ii.) If a central mind such
                as that of God directs the process, then the habits in
                question are not our sins but God's. (iii.) If, as above
                suggested, the process is in the hands of the evolving
                species, the bad or superseded habits are sinful, but
                they are not explained. Thus the evolutionary view of
                the question only restates the problem in terms which
                conceal the fact that no solution is offered."

                The fact that ideas refuted a century ago are today put

                a symptom of philosophical ignorance on the part of

            "In Hume's time a philosopher who denied the 
            innateness of moral sentiments, and held 
            that they must have a natural history, had 
            only the limits of the individual life 
            within which to trace this history.
            These limits did not give room enough for even a 
            plausible derivation of moral interests from animal wants.
            It is otherwise when the history may be 
            supposed to range over an indefinite number of generations.
            The doctrine of hereditary transmission, it is held, 
            explains to us how susceptibilities of pleasure and pain,
             of desire and aversion, of hope and fear, 
            may be handed down with gradually accumulated 
            modifications which in time attain the

            Such enquiry, it is thought, will in time 
            give us the means of reducing the moral 
            susceptibilities of man to the rank of 
            ordinary physical facts, parts of one system,

            regard the process of man's natural development

            <br>
            
            The above was published in 1883.
            <br>
            <br>
            What is interesting to me in the passage is:
            <br>
            <br>
            
            1) Evolutionary ethics had already been propounded 
            by 1883 in a form very close to the one it has today.
            It is not some new discovery of the sociobiologists 
            of the 1970s or the later evolutionary ethicists of the present day.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            2) Idealists such as Green (and Bosanquet and 
            Collingwood and Oakshott) understood the theory 
            perfectly well, and even acknowledged its 
            genuine achievements in partly explaining how we 
            have come to have the ethics we do have.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            3) The chief problem with the theory was already well understood:
            while it might explain, in whole or in part, why we do behave the 
            way we do, it cannot possibly recommend how we ought to behave,
            and fact renders such recommendations otiose: they are like 
            recommending to amoebas that they stop reproducing 
            asexually and get on with having sex like us more advanced beings.

            Francis of Assisi, and was, in fact,
            fantastically more successful at passing on his genes.
            It is hard to see how something calling itself 
            "evolutionary ethics" could argue, with a straight face, 
            that capturing women and using them as sexual slaves 
            is "wrong," so long as one is fairly certain to be able 
            to successfully implement that strategy.
            (Of course, a society where every single male tried to 
            do this would not turn out too well, but if someone was 
            certain that he would be as successful as Khan, 
            how could the "evolutionary ethicist" 
            say anything other than "Help yourself!"?)

                but still hold that, say, the view "slavery is A-OK" is wrong 
                and our current view is correct is to say something like, 
                "Well, this is part of an evolutionary process."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                If what they mean by this is, "This shift is part of a 
                spiritual learning process by which humanity comes closer 
                to understanding objective moral reality," well, 
                that concedes my point.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                On the other hand, if they are thinking in terms of 
                Darwinian evolution, the argument goes nowhere. 
                It embodies the vulgar Darwinism that equates "evolution" 
                with "progress," a mapping Darwinism properly understood 
                forbids. It recalls that Darwinian evolution involves 
                "survival of the fittest," but forgets that it 
                also involves "wiping out of the not fittest."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                The species living on earth today represent perhaps 
                .1% of all species that have ever existed. So, 99.9% 
                of what evolved "failed"! For every one evolutionary 
                "progression" that survives today, a thousand didn't 
                make it... and that doesn't even count all of the 
                random mutations that never produced a distinct 
                species. 99.9% of species turned out to be 
                evolutionary dead ends.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                If one takes a "naturalistic" view of evolution, 
                it is completely invalid to move from "Y evolved from X" 
                to "therefore, Y represents progress over X." 
                The tyrannical, late Roman Empire "evolved" from the 
                Roman Republic, after all: do these naive believers 
                in progress wish to insist that it was therefore better?
                <br>
                <br>
                
                And note: most often, the entire idea of "progressive" 
                politics relies on this nonsensical conflation 
                of evolution and progress.

            <h4>
            It's the Same Old DeWrong, with a Different Beat Since Reason's Been Gone
            </h4>
            
            <p>
             It is always fascinating when one can detect an irrational obsession in
             an otherwise smart person. I have no doubt Brad DeLong is smart. But
             when it comes to any questioning of reductionist materialist dogma,
             DeLong just loses it. For instance, in "responding" to Steve Landsburg,
             he starts a post off as follows:
             <br>
             <br>
            
             "Someone who claims to be a 'friend' makes me aware that others are 
             joining Alvin Plantzinga and Gene Callahan on the side of Thomas Nagel's
             creationists..." (Is 'friend' perhaps in quotes here because DeLong 
             has no friends and knows this person must be making the claim up?
             Hahaha, just kidding, Brad, I'm sure you have at least one friend!)
             <br>
             <br>
            
             Here, we have hit upon the Paretian "residue" that drives DeLong's
             irrational rants: he hates creationists. Now, Nagel is not
             a creationist, I am not a creationist, and Landsburg is not
             a creationist, but DeLong is afraid, very, very afraid, that
             some creationists might like some of the things we say! So what
             we say must be stamped out at all cost, even at the cost of 
             spouting nonsense, making up arguments and putting them in one's
             opponents mouth, and random name-calling with no regard to when
             the name applies and when it doesn't.
             <br>
             <br>
            
             The title of DeLong's post is: "THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
             OUR MINDS ARE TOO POWERFUL TO BE THE RESULT OF PURELY DARWINIAN
             PROCESSES." Yeah, why all caps? I don't know. But who has made
             any claim about the "power" of our minds? Nagel? No. Me? No. 
             Landsburg? No. DeLong has simply invented this out of whole cloth!
             The real issue, as far as I understand Nagel, and certainly as
             I would put it, is "Why should evolution, understood in purely
             Darwinian terms, have spawned organisms that are conscious and
             can reason, instead of just spawning automatons that can survive
             without thought?" I am not saying that this question is not 
             answerable by strict Darwinians (perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't);
             no, I am just saying that DeLong has totally missed the point:
             it is not a question of "power," but quite the opposite:
             if, as you reductionists insist, mere mechanisms thoughtlessly
             implementing algorithms can evolve so as to continually enhance
             their own survival, what the heck is the evolutionary point of
             making them all worried and neurotic by developing 
             consciousness in them? Now, Darwinists may or may not be able
             to give an adequate answer to that question; that is not what
             I wish to discuss here. No, my point is that DeLong has 
            not even engaged with the real question at all.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Nagel (as I understand his argument from reviews, not having 
            read the book) is claiming that, while Darwinian evolution may 
            account quite well for a lot of what we find in life, it is 
            incomplete. Well, isn't that exactly what the scientific 
            attitude towards all of our scientific theories is supposed to be? 
            They are all provisional, and all will be supplanted by 
            better theories one day? (For the record, I regard Darwin's 
            theory as one of the greatest achievements of science. In fact, 
            with my daughter, who appears to be very adept at biological 
            reasoning, I often present her with little challenges: 
            "Emma, think about this trait: how would you account for 
            it in terms of evolution?" She typically then uses her 
            knowledge of evolution and her reason to devise a very nice
            answer.)
            <br>
            <br>
            
            So who is being "unscientific" here: Nagel, who acknowledges 
            the genuine achievements of this theory but notes it leaves 
            some things unexplained, or the "evolutiomentalists," 
            who dogmatically insist that, "No, if you doubt the total 
            and complete explanatory power of this theory for even 
            a moment, you must be cast out as a heretic"?
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Finally, look at the rubbish DeLong launches at Landsburg: 
            because in the case of a neutron star, it is not true that 
            "The ratio π of the circumference of a circle to its 
            radius is such that 6.29 &gt; 2&pi; &gt; 6.28," 
            therefore Landsburg has 'self pwned.'"
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Oh my. How about this, DeWrong: "The closer any real 
            space comes to being Euclidean, the more closely will 
            the equation given above be accurate for relating 
            the circumference of a circle in that space to its radius."
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The above certainly seems to be a statement 
            about reality. Does DeLong really want to deny it?

	    <h4>Peter Klein Doesn't Grasp the History of Science</h4>

	    <p>
	    Klein is trying to knock Krugman by rejecting the
	    idea that we can have a science of higher-level phenomena
	    before understanding the lower levels that make the 
	    higher level up:
	    </p>
	    <br>

	    <p>
	    "Methodological individualists don’t deny that there

	    underlying causal mechanisms."
	    </p>
	    <br>
	   

	    <p>
	    And that denial is nonsense. Kepler certainly was doing
	    science, and good science, when he developed his laws of
	    planetary motion, without having any idea what underlay those
	    laws. And so was Newton, when he developed his law of 
	    universal gravitation, without the least notion of what
	    underlying casual mechanisms were behind this regularity -- 
	    something he freely admitted himself. And both 
	    physics and chemistry would have been stopped in 
	    their tracks by trying to be Kleinian "sciences": they 
	    progressed for centuries before it was even clear 
	    that atoms existed.

	    Peter has to go so far as to claim that Darwin's theory of

	    Well, when you try to spit into the headwind of the

	    To Klein's credit, when someone in the comments noted similar 
	    things to what I point out here, Peter backed off. But not far enough 
	    to admit the truth, which is that Krugman was right in the first place,
