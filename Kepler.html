          James A. Connor, formerly a Jesuit
          priest and currently a professor of English
          at Kean University, has written an
          engaging account of the life and times of
          astronomer and mathematician Johannes
          Kepler, who lived from 1571 to 1630.
          Kepler is most famous for his three laws
          of planetary motion, the first of which
          advanced the revolutionary idea that the
          orbits of the planets are elliptical.
          Before him, all prominent theorists,
          including Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus,
          Brahe, and Galileo, assumed that
          they must be circular.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          While Connor does offer an overview
          of Kepler's scientific work, that is not the
          focus of Kepler's Witch. The author
          devotes much more attention to how the
          waves of conflict battering 17th-century
          Europe engulfed Kepler despite his lack
          of interest in politics and his devotion to
          the idea of Christian unity. Kepler's life
          was spent within the Holy Roman
          Empire, in places that today would be in
          Germany, Austria, or the Czech Republic.
          That put him at the confluence of the
          great currents of Protestant Reformation
          and Catholic Counter-Reformation.
          Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Catholicism
          competed for the souls of central
          Europe, each of them claiming to be the
          one true Christian faith. The result was
          decades of war, purges, persecution,
          and forced migration. Although Kepler
          disdained Christian factionalism, his scientific
          fame condemned him to embroilment
          in the general strife. The various
          sects were not of a mind to accept neutrality
          as a valid stance; one was either
          with them or against them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The title of Connor's book refers to the
          trial of Kepler's mother, Katharina, on
          charges of witchcraft. The author treats
          her tribulations as an emblem of how
          ordinary people could be swept up by the
          larger tides of the time despite their
          efforts to avoid the deeps. As described
          by Connor, Katharina was "stubborn,
          cranky... and simply couldn't keep her
          nose out of other people's business." But
          other than her dabbling in herbal remedies,
          there is no evidence of her practicing
          witchcraft. The case against her
          seems to have sprung from personal
          malice and survived on political ill will.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It began when Katharina quarreled
          with a well-connected neighbor, who
          then claimed she had been cursed by
          Frau Kepler. This neighbor used her contacts
          to make sure that the case was pursued.
          Johannes's unpopular insistence
          on the sovereignty of the individual conscience
          then entered the picture. As
          Connor writes, to some of the locals, "as
          suspect as Katharina was... her son
          Johannes was far worse. He must have
          been crazy, and a witch himself, a follower
          of Copernicus and a heretic."
          Indeed, a small fable the astronomer had
          composed, about "a man whose mother
          introduced him to the demons of the air,
          who carried him to the moon," was introduced
          at his mother's trial, "as evidence
          of both Katharina's and Johannes's
          odious associations with the devil."
          Johannes, however, internationally
          famous and the Holy Roman Emperor's
          official mathematician, was not a target
          that a provincial official could hope to
          strike. Perhaps prosecuting his mother
          seemed like the next best thing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The case against Katharina dragged
          on for seven years, from 1613 to 1620.
          Johannes did his best to aid her, writing
          most of her defense brief, petitioning
          noblemen he had met during his career
          on her behalf, and finally leaving his
          home in Austria to be with his mother
          for the close of her trial. She was
          declared guilty, but, since the evidence
          against her was circumstantial, she was
          not sentenced to death. Instead, she was
          subjected to the territio verbalis, in
          which the convicted party is brought to
          a place of torture. There, a torturer
          offers dire warnings of the consequences
          of not confessing her evil and
          renouncing the devil, while showing her
          the instruments of his trade. Katharina,
          despite the grim circumstances, con-
          firmed her reputation for stubbornness
          by refusing to admit any guilt.
       </p>
       
       <p>
          Johannes Kepler's inability to rescue
          his mother from what were patently corrupt
          judicial proceedings, despite his
          fame and position, stemmed chiefly
          from his refusal to subordinate his own
          understanding of scripture and knowledge
          of God to any received dogma.
          That refusal denied him a secure home
          in any of the established churches, and,
          as a consequence, there was no powerful
          organization behind him in the legal
          or political struggle.
       </p>
       
       <p>
          Kepler was born into the Lutheran
          Church. One of Luther's central ideas
          was that individuals could interpret
          scripture for themselves. But, faced with
          increasing dissension between Lutheran
          factions, its founder long dead, the
          church devised its own official dogma,
          the Formula of Concord. Kepler did not
          accept one of its crucial tenets, the
          "ubiquity doctrine," which held that
          Christ is present in the Eucharistic
          bread and wine because, being God, he
          is present everywhere. (The Catholic
          Church, on the other hand, asserted that
          the substance of the sacramental offerings
          was physically transformed into the
          body and blood of Christ. Kepler leaned
          toward a third, Calvinist doctrine: the
          communicant received special help
          from Christ when receiving the sacra-
          ment.) Johannes was eventually excommunicated
          from the Lutheran Church
          for his deviant view. Nevertheless, he
          always considered himself a faithful
          Lutheran.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the Catholic Church,
          aware of Kepler's uneasy relationship
          with the religion of his birth, made
          repeated attempts to convert him. Doing
          so would have been a public relations
          coup, as Kepler was not only respected
          for his scientific achievements, but
          also known to be intellectually honest
          and apolitical. Since the emperor was
          Catholic, conversion would also have
          benefited Kepler's career and improved
          the security of his family. Several Jesuit
          priests discussed the idea with him at
          various times. The Jesuits were the
          Catholic Church's intellectual advance
          guard, and, as such, they were quite
          familiar with Kepler and his scientific
          work. Indeed, Johannes was close to
          many members of the order, even staying
          at the homes of several while traveling.
          Their efforts had enough effect that
          Kepler said he was willing to declare
          himself a Catholic, but only on his own
          terms. In response to one friend's suggestion
          that he convert, Kepler wrote:
          "Just as I entered my life my parents initiated
          me into the Catholic church,
          sprinkled me with the holy water of baptism...
          Since that time until now, I have
          never left the Catholic church." But
          Kepler did not regard Catholics as only
          those who acknowledged papal authority
          (which he did not). He was willing to
          call himself Catholic, attend Catholic
          services, and even keep his differences
          of opinion with church doctrine to himself.
          But he would never profess belief in
          ideas with which he disagreed. The
          church would not accept such a conditional
          Catholic.

        <p>
          A second, related theme running
          through <i>Kepler's Witch</i> is that Kepler's scientific
          quest was motivated and guided by
          his faith. His philosophical views are
          probably best categorized as Christian
          Neoplatonism. He pursued mathematics
          and astronomy because he believed they
          could reveal God's harmonious presence
          in His creation. Kepler believed such
          chords resonated with humans because,
          to quote Connor, "God has planted even
          deeper harmonies, and the ability to recognize
          them, into each person at birth."
          Science served both to praise God and to
          bring the human soul into closer contact
          with Him. As Connor puts it, "all his science
          was at heart a prayer."
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Although it has many virtues, <i>Kepler's
            Witch</i> suffers from a few serious flaws.
          For one thing, Connor's writing is fairly
          sloppy at times, which is especially surprisingly
          since he teaches English. For
          example, the fact that Kepler was
          friendly with many Jesuits is mentioned
          at least three times, two of them only ten
          pages apart, in each instance as though
          the fact had not been previously introduced.
          Perhaps Connor's target audience
          suffers from short-term memory loss. He
          describes Prague before the Counter Reformation
          as "a glorious hodgepodge
          of Catholic and Protestant and Jew," but
          says that afterwards Prague was "Catholic
          to the core."
          Then he notes "the Jews
          were still there." So did two-thirds of the
          "hodgepodge" remain, or was the city
          "Catholic to the core"?
        </p>
          
        <p>
          In a passage addressing the execution
          in Prague of a number of Protestant
          rebels on the order of the Holy Roman
          Emperor Ferdinand, Connor first notes
          that there were 27 condemned men.
          Then he mentions that there were 27
          coffins. Finally, as if presenting us with a
          great surprise, he adds that there was
          "one victim for each coffin." Did he
          worry that readers might suspect that
          some of the coffins had three or four
          bodies jammed into them while others
          remained empty?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Another problem is that Connor doesn't
          always seem to have a firm grasp on
          the theoretical points he describes. For
          instance, he says that since Kepler "identifies
          the created mind of the human
          being with the two-dimensional circle...
          therefore the polygons that could be
          inscribed inside a circle Kepler said
          actually existed in the mind." I must confess
          that I am completely at a loss as to
          how the first idea implies the second.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The author also seems to have the
          notion of "accounting for the appearances,"
          which was the Catholic Church's
          model of astronomical research, precisely
          backwards. As I understand it, it
          meant that astronomical theories should
          be regarded as attempts to predict the
          movements of celestial bodies, rather
          than efforts to describe the true nature
          of the heavens. But Connor's version of
          the idea is that "not only was the model
          true. It was righteously true." A bit later,
          he says that the 17th-century belief in
          witches "was not a superstition, as some
          Enlightenment writers would claim -- it
          was a worldview." But are the two categories
          mutually exclusive? Couldn't one
          have a superstitious worldview?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A minor flaw, but one that I found
          frustrating, is that the book lacks of a
          map of 17th-century central Europe.
          The story deals frequently with Kepler's
          movements and a map would have
          made those passages much easier to
          follow for those of us not intimate with
          the location of Moravia, Swabia, Silesia,
          or Lusatia.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        While <i>Kepler's Witch</i> would be a
          much better book if not for such lapses,
          Connor has still done an admirable job
          of conveying both Kepler's ideas and the
          historical context of his life. As noted in
          a jacket blurb by writer Larry Witham,
          Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton have
          all had their day in the sun. Connor
          makes a fair bid to grant Kepler's his
          own, while also depicting his life as a
          paradigm of the challenge that genius
          presents to orthodoxy.
