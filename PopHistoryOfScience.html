          <h4>How Bad Is Pop History of Science?</h4>
      
          <p>
          Renaissance Mathematicus gives 
          <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">an example here</a>. 
          The author of the piece critiqued -- which was
          published by <em>Scientific American!</em>
          -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain 
          retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the 
          major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation
          of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" 
          -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well. I studied the history
          of science for a year at King's College in London. 
          Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop
          history of science was complete nonsense. And note: 
          although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves
          religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em>
          piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, 
          concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no
          idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.

	  <h4>The (Ideological) History of Science</h4>
	
	  <p>
	  I just picked up The Scientists by John Gribbin. 
	  I had thought I was bying a book on the history of science, 
	  but unfortunately I've discovered I have bought a work of ideology
          disguised as history.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	
	  Gribbin opens by saying "The most important thing science has
	  taught us about our place in the Universe is that we are not special."
	  Oh really, and just how did science discover that "fact"? Is there some
	  "specialness-omter" scientist have invented recently? What
	  is the measure of "specialness" that proves Gribbin's assertion?
	  <br>
	  <br>

       	  There is none, for of course the assertion is sheer rubbish.
	  The contention of Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and so on is
	  not that humanity is special in possessing some unique physical property
	  -- which science might be able to disprove -- but that humanity
	  is spiritually special. Buddhism, for instance, contends that
	  humans are spiritually uniquely positioned to achieve enlightenment.
	  Just how is science supposed to have "taught" us that this is not so?
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  One of Gribbin's arguments for how science shows we
 	  are not special is the old chestnut about the Copernican
	  system removing man from his "special" location at the center
	  of the universe, a move that supposedly "demoted" man from a
	  place of prime importance in creation. There is one
	  rather serious problem with this oft-repeated tale:
	  while it is true that, in Aristotelean and Medieval cosmologies,
	  the center was a special place to be, that is because
	  it was an especially bad place. For Aristotle,
	  the center was where gross, corrupt matter descended,
	  and it was the heavens that were perfect and unchanging,
	  and the closest realm to God. As my lecturer in the
	  history of science at King's College, John Milton, asked:
	  Who was at the center of the universe in Dante's
	  Divine Comedy? Why, Satan, of course, and hell!
	  And Professor Milton mentioned that he could find
	  no record of anyone at the time worried about Copernicus
	  because man would no longer be at the center. This
	  idea is almost certainly an invention of the same
	  Enlightenment anti-clerical thinkers who invented
	  "The Middle Ages," and who falsely alleged
	  that Medieval natural philosophers held that the Earth is flat.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  Gribbin continues: "It would have been natural
	  [given the great ruins left by the Ancients] to
          accept that they were intellectually far superior to
          the ordinary people who had followed them, and to accept
	  the teaching of the ancient philosophers such as Aristotle
	  and Euclid as a kind of Holy Writ, which could not be questioned."
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  But that is precisely what Medieval thinkers did
	  not do with Aristotle. Medieval thinkers generally
	  considered themselves the superiors, not the inferiors,
	  of the Ancients, because they had Christ's revelation at hand.
	  Indeed, many Christian thinkers urged their fellows to
	  ignore the Ancient philosophers as having nothing to teach
	  Christians. And almost as soon as Aristotle's works
	  were re-discovered, they were questioned. The Church
	  issued edicts as to the many contentions of Aristotle's that
	  had to be rejected. Buridan and Orseme seriously modified
	  his mechanics. The idea that these people unthinkingly 
	  accepted every word of Aristotle's is historical nonsense.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  Euclid is a somewhat different story, for,
	  while Euclid was unchallenged in the Middle Ages,
	  so he was also by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton,
	  and Kant! It was not until the 19th-century that
	  non-Euclidean geometries were developed.
	  <br>
	  <br>

 	  And, ironically, the attitude of inferiority to the
	  Ancients really came to the fore with the rise of Humanism
	  in the Renaissance -- just when Gribbin says it was ending!
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  Gribbin actually gets much, much better once
	  he is done with the Middle Ages. I have the feeling
	  he actually researched the period from 1450 on,
	  whereas he just cribbed popular opinion for his 
	  views on everything earlier.

	  <h4>The Rationality of Science</h4>
	
	  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Ant_Nebula.jpg" img align="middle">

	  <p>
	  The great figures of the Scientific Revolution
	  -- Galileo, Kepler, Newton -- were crystal clear on why
	  science could be a rational enterprise: scientists
	  were reading Nature, "the book of God"... and God being
	  the supremely rational mind, naturally the book
	  had a rational design, one that, with effort, 
	  our more limited minds could follow.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  The major part of the history of the philosophy 
	  of science since the 18th-century has been the
	   hunt to find some other, any other, basis for
	   science's rationality. Once Hume destroyed
	  the purely empiricist case for science,
	  the search had an air of desperation to it.
	  Instrumentalism, verificationism, falsificationism:
	  all were attempts to patch up the whole Hume had noted.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  All these attempts have failed.

          <h4>Pop history of science is often pretty terrible</h4>
          
          <p>
          <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">
          An actual historian</a> 
          looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it
          is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, 
          "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land." 
          And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account,
          in which Potter wrote "...how the young Newton, sent 
          home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665,
          was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground,
          and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity." 
          Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and 
          it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.
          But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em>
          "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a 
          formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave.
          But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing
          this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.
