            The popular history of science is usually pretty awful. Sometimes
            the awfulness stems from an ideological bias, typically against
            religion. But many other times, people simply have no idea what
            they are talking about, and think they can just make up history
            based upon "this is how it <i>must</i> have happened!" This chapter
            examines some popular myths about the history of science.

            <h4>
                The History and Pseudo-History of Science
            </h4>
      

<p>
Recently, after looking in an introductory biology textbook for a description
of meiosis, I browsed through its introduction. There, I came upon the
following passage:
</p>

<p>
“For 2,000 years prior to [the Renaissance], scholars had accepted the writings
of Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, as well as certain Church
doctrines, to be unfaltering truths about the natural world. It took some of
the greatest minds in history, including Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton, to
shake this dominion of dogma and to replace it with theories and laws based on
direct observation of nature. Nicholaus Copernicus, and later Galileo, made
calculations that the Earth and other planets circle the sun…” (Wessells and
Hopson, 1988, p. 11).
</p>

<p>
Many science textbooks contain similar one-or-two-paragraph histories of how
modern science miraculously emerged from the dark swamp of ignorance we call
the Middle Ages. The main problem with such stories is that they are almost
entirely false. Let’s compare the picture painted above with the current
understanding of scholars studying the history of the Scientific Revolution.
</p>

<p>
The first assertion, quite a commonplace one, is that from the time of the
ancient Greeks until the Renaissance, the European mind was in the thrall of a
dogmatic worldview, based only on authority, and made no progress toward a
better understanding of the natural world. It is certainly true that scientific
ideas developed much less rapidly during most of the period in question than
they have in recent centuries. (Even admitting that much, the figure of “2000
years” in the quote above still seems to overshoot the mark, since it includes
the time of pioneers like Archimedes and Ptolemy within its scope.) During the
“Dark Ages,” in the centuries immediately after the fall of Rome, Western
Europe did not challenge the received wisdom in science primarily because it
did not do much science at all. People were struggling to survive, and
intellectual life fell into abeyance. In fact, contrary to the view expressed
in the biology textbook, for most of that period, Aristotle’s writings were
lost to the West, so that they could hardly have been accepted as “unfaltering
truths”!
</p>

<p>
But as Western European intellectual life revived, scholars began reconsidering
the ideas of the ancients. As Bede’s Library has it:
</p>

<p>
“When Aristotle was rediscovered in the West, it was soon established that when
there were clear conflicts between his philosophy and the Christian faith, the
latter should always prevail. This was not much of a handicap, as on the
subject of physical science, faith did not really have a lot to say. The bible
could be read non-literally where necessary, as Augustine himself allowed, so
William of Conches could even call the creation account in Genesis figurative.
Nearly everyone agreed that the earth was a sphere even though the Bible
implied a flat earth. But where Aristotle and faith were in clear conflict,
such as his claim that the world was uncreated and eternal, it weakened his
authority and allowed his ideas to be challenged. This opened the door to the
idea of a developing body of knowledge, which is often assumed to have been
absent from the medieval outlook.”
</p>

<p>
For example, in the fourteenth century, a group of philosophers, most of them
at the University of Paris, developed the impetus theory of motion. It was both
a break with one of the central ideas of Aristotle’s physics, and a step toward
the modern theory of inertia. They also disputed the prevailing belief that the
movement of each planet was guided by a conscious being:
</p>

<p>
“Although the theory of celestial intelligences became a central doctrine in
Hellenic, Arabic and scholastic cosmology, it was attacked during the
fourteenth century by several scholars, and most incisively in the work of Jean
Buridan (died c. 1358) and his pupil Nicole Oresme (1320–1382).”
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Aristotelian physics did remain the primary means of explaining
most physical phenomena well into the Scientific Revolution. There is a very
good reason for that, which brings us to our next point. The textbook cited
above claims that scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton were able
“to shake this dominion of [Aristotelian] dogma” with “theories and laws based
on direct observation of nature.” Once again, the authors are repeating a
commonplace view, one that appears in a multitude of popular accounts of the
rise of science. The scholastic philosophers who dominated the medieval
universities, enraptured with their elaborate metaphysical speculations,
ignored the plain facts of the physical world, which were accessible to them if
they had simply looked around. The great figures of the Scientific Revolution
relied instead on observation, which led them to develop the theories that
replaced Aristotelian physics.
</p>

<p>
But this story, inspiring though it is, runs afoul of the fact that Aristotle
was a masterful observer, one whose physical theories are closely based on the
world as it appears to the unaided senses. Knowledge, he held, begins with our
observations of the world around us. Similarly, Ptolemy constructed his
Earth-centered model of the cosmos to accurately reflect the best astronomical
observations available to him.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it was the pioneers of the Scientific Revolution who had to overcome
the commonsense view of the world revealed by direct observation in order for
their theories to gain acceptance. The most obvious discrepancy between the
reports of our senses and the new ideas is that the Earth seems quite plainly
to be standing still, while the heavenly bodies clearly appear to be rotating
around it. Renaissance man had no experience of, for instance, traveling in an
airplane at 600 miles per hour yet feeling as though he wasn’t moving. When he
moved rapidly, such as on horseback, he could feel that he was moving. And to
account for the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, the Earth would have
to rotate at what, for him, was a truly astonishing rate. (At the equator, the
actual speed is over 1000 miles per hour.)
</p>

<p>
What’s more, if the Earth was spinning around that rapidly, it seemed that we
ought to be able to detect that motion in many ways. For example, if you
dropped a rock from a tower, it should fall some distance from the tower’s
base, in the direction opposite to the Earth’s rotation, since the ground would
have moved under it as it was falling. The Earth’s atmosphere would also be
left behind, so that there would be a continuous wind sweeping from east to
west at hundreds of miles per hour.
</p>

<p>
On a more technical level, a major reason that Copernicus’s heliocentric
(sun-centered) theory was rejected by many leading astronomers of the sixteenth
century was the absence of any observed parallax in the “fixed stars.” Parallax
is the astronomical term for the fact that objects will appear to change their
location when observed from different places. If the Earth revolves around the
sun, the stars should appear to move slightly during the course of the year,
but astronomers observed no such phenomena. (The explanation for that failure
is that the stars are much farther away from the Earth than anyone at that time
suspected, so that the parallax was too minute for their instruments to
detect.)
</p>

<p>
Copernicus handled the difficulty that presented for his theory with an ad hoc
hypothesis, declaring that the sphere of the stars was ten times farther from
the Earth than had previously been believed. Not only was the hypothesis ad
hoc, it was also, as a Popperian would put it, unfalsifiable: there were no
instruments available at the time to measure a parallax as small as the new
distance implied. And if a geocentric astronomer had developed a device capable
of measuring such a slight change in observed position, Copernicus could (and
undoubtedly would) have simply moved the stellar sphere ten times farther away
still.
</p>

<p>
Copernicus also "was puzzled by the variations he had observed in the
brightness of the planet Mars. [But] Copernicus's own system was so far from
answering to the phenomena in the case of Mars that Galileo in his main work on
this subject praises him for clinging to his new theory though it contradicted
observation…" (Butterfield, 1949, p. 23).
</p>

<p>
What’s more, as we noted above, Copernicanism violated many of the principles
of the Aristotelian physics of his time. Copernicus could not explain why
objects didn't fly off the rotating Earth, why the Earth didn't spin itself
apart, why dropped objects fell straight to the ground, or what kept celestial
objects going in their orbits if not the motion transmitted from sphere to
sphere in the Ptolemaic/Aristotelian model. Aristotelian physics explained all
of those phenomena in ways that made sense of the observational experience then
available. As Butterfield writes:
</p>

<p>
"In fact, you had to throw over the very frameboard of existing science, and it
was here that Copernicus clearly failed to provide an alternative. He provided
a neater geometry of the heavens, but it was one which made nonsense of the
reasons and explanations that had previously been given to account for the
movements in the sky" (1949, p. 27).
</p>

<p>
Of course, Aristotelian physics had difficulties of its own, but Copernicanism
introduced a whole host of new problems, while only eliminating a few: "Most of
the essential elements by which we know the Copernican Revolution — easy and
accurate computations of planetary position, the abolition of epicycles and
eccentrics, the dissolution of the spheres, the sun a star, the infinite
expansion of the universe — these and many others are not to be found anywhere
in Copernicus's work" (Kuhn, 1957, p. 135).
</p>

<p>
Nor does the frequent assertion that Copernicus's theory was significantly
simpler than Ptolemy’s stand up to scrutiny. As Lakatos notes:
</p>

<p>
"The superior simplicity of the Copernican theory was just as much of a myth as
its superior accuracy. The myth of superior simplicity was dispelled by the
careful and professional work of modern historians. They reminded us that while
Copernican theory solves certain problems in a simpler way than does the
Ptolemaic one, the price of the simplification is unexpected complications in
the solution of other problems. The Copernican system is certainly simpler
since it dispenses with equants and some eccentrics; but each equant and
eccentric removed has to be replaced by new epicycles and epicyclets…. he also
has to put the centre of the universe not at the Sun, as he originally
intended, but at an empty point fairly near to it."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion that Galileo had all of the evidence on his side in his battle
against the Aristotelians and the Church is also erroneous. In his book Two
Systems one of the major pieces of evidence he advanced for the Copernican
model was the existence of tides. Galileo explained them as arising from the
motion of the Earth rocking the oceans back and forth, much as a swinging a
bucket containing water will slosh the water up one side of the bucket and then
the other.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is quite different from our current understanding of tides as
arising from the gravitational influence of the moon. But what is really
surprising about Galileo’s hypothesis, given his common portrayal as a staunch
empiricist, is that he had not even investigated the actual period of the tides
before forwarding this argument! His theory required a 24-hour tidal cycle,
while in fact it is 12 hours. When he learned that sailors in the Mediterranean
reported high and low tides occurring every 12 hours, he explained this glaring
discrepancy as resulting from local variations in the ocean bottom. (See Shea
and Artigas, 2003.)
</p>

<p>
Galileo also failed to be a “good empiricist” when he ignored his ally Kepler’s
theory that the planets orbit the sun in elliptical, rather than circular,
paths. Kepler’s model fit the data much better than Galileo’s, yet Kepler’s
letters to Galileo suggesting elliptical orbits never even solicited a
response.
</p>

<p>
When one looks at the real history of the Scientific Revolution, it becomes
apparent that observation was rarely the prime impetus for the development of
the most important new theories. Instead, leading scientists drew their main
inspiration from their beliefs about the kind of world they envisioned that God
would create. Copernicus and Kepler were Neo-Platonists, and it seemed to them
that the Sun, the most brilliant light in our world, was a more fitting center
for God’s creation than the Earth. Copernicus was also dissatisfied with the
Ptolemaic model of the heavens because it centered the orbits of heavenly
bodies not on the Earth, the supposed center of the cosmos, but on a point
called the equant, which was an empty spot in space near to the Earth. Newton
was a deeply religious man, who believed that God’s work would naturally
exhibit the sort of mathematical perfection he hoped to reflect in his own
theories.
</p>

<p>
I came across another very common idea about the Scientific Revolution in
browsing a recent issue of National Geographic. Speculating on the impact of
the possible future discovery of other, earth-like planets, the article’s
author writes: “It’s hard to overstate the excitement scientists feel at the
prospect of seeing that faint blue dot. If it told of a watery, temperate
place, humanity would face a 21st-century version of Copernicus’s realization
nearly 500 years ago that the Earth is not the center of the solar system. The
discovery would show ‘that were not in a special place, that we might be part
of a continuum of life in the cosmos, and that life might be very common,’ says
Michael Meyer, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.”
</p>

<p>
As a corollary of the above, it’s often suggested that many people in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries rejected the idea of a sun-centered solar
system because it displaced the Earth from its unique location at the center of
the universe, and therefore seemed to make humanity less important in the
scheme of creation. However, Professor John Milton, with whom I studied the
history of science at King’s College in London, noted that historians have
discovered no evidence of any of the contemporaries of Copernicus or Galileo
voicing such a concern. And that is not too surprising, when we consider that,
in the prevailing cosmology of the time, the center of the cosmos was not a
very prestigious place to be. Aristotle regarded it as the region to which
gross and corrupt matter gravitated, distinctly inferior to the unchanging
perfection exhibited by the heavens. And in Dante’s Divine Comedy, the occupant
of the Earth’s center, and therefore at the precise center of the universe, was
none other than Satan himself. To place the Earth in the heavens was to grant
it a promotion.
</p>

<p>
None of what I have presented above is meant to claim that the conservatism
typical of entrenched interests, for instance, of the Aristotelians who
dominated the universities of the 16th and 17th centuries, did not present an
extra-scientific hurdle that new conceptions of the physical world had to
surmount, or that the Catholic Church never resisted the progress of science
for dogmatic reasons.
</p>

<p>
But the common, popular version of the history of science, in which unselfish,
heroic scientists do battle with the backward forces of religion, is a fairy
tale, spun mostly by Voltaire and his followers, in order to discredit the
religious belief that they despised. The real history of the Scientific
Revolution is much more complex and nuanced than the simplistic morality play
they made it out to be. If we are truly interested in understanding the roles
that religion and science have played in creating our civilization, we should
put aside the myth and attend to the reality.

            <h4>
                How Bad Is Pop History of Science?
            </h4>
      
            <p>
            The blogger "Renaissance Mathematicus" gives 
            <a href=
                "https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">
                an example here</a>. 
            The author of the piece critiqued -- which was
            published by <em>Scientific American!</em>
            -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain 
            retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the 
            major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation
            of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo 
            "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" 
            -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well. I studied the history
            of science for a year at King's College in London. 
            Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop
            history of science was complete nonsense. And note: 
            although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves
            religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em>
            piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, 
            concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no
            idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.
            </p>
  

    <hr>

            <h4>The (Ideological) History of Science</h4>
            
            <p>
            I just picked up <i>The Scientists</i> by John Gribbin. 
            I had thought I was bying a book on the history of science, 
            but unfortunately I've discovered I have bought a work of ideology
            disguised as history.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin opens by saying "The most important thing science has
            taught us about our place in the Universe is that we are not special."
            Oh really, and just how did science discover that "fact"? Is there some
            "specialness-omter" scientist have invented recently? What
            is the measure of "specialness" that proves Gribbin's assertion?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            There is none, for of course the assertion is sheer rubbish.
            The contention of Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and so on is
            not that humanity is special in possessing some unique physical property
            -- which science might be able to disprove -- but that humanity
            is spiritually special. Buddhism, for instance, contends that
            humans are spiritually uniquely positioned to achieve enlightenment.
            Just how is science supposed to have "taught" us that this is not so?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            One of Gribbin's arguments for how science shows we
            are not special is the old chestnut about the Copernican
            system removing man from his "special" location at the center
            of the universe, a move that supposedly "demoted" man from a
            place of prime importance in creation. There is one
            rather serious problem with this oft-repeated tale:
            while it is true that, in Aristotelean and Medieval cosmologies,
            the center was a special place to be, that is because
            it was an especially bad place. For Aristotle,
            the center was where gross, corrupt matter descended,
            and it was the heavens that were perfect and unchanging,
            and the closest realm to God. As my lecturer in the
            history of science at King's College, John Milton, asked:
            Who was at the center of the universe in Dante's
            <i>Divine Comedy</i>? Why, Satan, of course, and hell!
            And Professor Milton mentioned that he could find
            no record of anyone at the time worried about Copernicus
            because man would no longer be at the center. This
            idea is almost certainly an invention of the same
            Enlightenment anti-clerical thinkers who invented
            "The Middle Ages," and who falsely alleged
            that Medieval natural philosophers held that the Earth is flat.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin continues: "It would have been natural
            [given the great ruins left by the Ancients] to
            accept that they were intellectually far superior to
            the ordinary people who had followed them, and to accept
            the teaching of the ancient philosophers such as Aristotle
            and Euclid as a kind of Holy Writ, which could not be questioned."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But that is precisely what Medieval thinkers did
            not do with Aristotle. Medieval thinkers generally
            considered themselves the superiors, not the inferiors,
            of the Ancients, because they had Christ's revelation at hand.
            Indeed, many Christian thinkers urged their fellows to
            ignore the Ancient philosophers as having nothing to teach
            Christians. And almost as soon as Aristotle's works
            were re-discovered, they were questioned. The Church
            issued edicts as to the many contentions of Aristotle's that
            had to be rejected. Buridan and Orseme seriously modified
            his mechanics. The idea that these people unthinkingly 
            accepted Aristotle's every word is historical nonsense.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Euclid is a somewhat different story, for,
            while Euclid was unchallenged in the Middle Ages,
            so he was also unchallenged by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton,
            and Kant! It was not until the 19th-century that
            non-Euclidean geometries were developed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            And, ironically, the attitude of inferiority to the
            Ancients really came to the fore with the rise of Humanism
            in the Renaissance -- just when Gribbin says it was ending!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin actually gets much, much better once
            he is done with the Middle Ages. I have the feeling
            he actually researched the period from 1450 on,
            whereas he just cribbed popular opinion for his 
            views on everything earlier.
            </p>

            <h4>The Rationality of Science</h4>
            
            
            <p>
            The great figures of the Scientific Revolution
            -- Galileo, Kepler, Newton -- were crystal clear on why
            science could be a rational enterprise: scientists
            were reading Nature, "the book of God"... and God being
            the supremely rational mind, naturally the book
            had a rational design, one that, with effort, 
            our more limited minds could follow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The major part of the history of the philosophy 
            of science since the 18th-century has been the
            hunt to find some other, any other, basis for
            science's rationality. Once Hume destroyed
            the purely empiricist case for science,
            the search had an air of desperation to it.
            Instrumentalism, verificationism, falsificationism:
            all were attempts to patch up the hole Hume had noted.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            All these attempts have failed.
            </p>
            
    <hr>

            <h4>Pop History of Science Is Often Pretty Terrible</h4>
            
            <p>
            <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">
            An actual historian</a> 
            looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it
            is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, 
            "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land." 
            And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account,
            in which Potter wrote "...how the young Newton, sent 
            home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665,
            was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground,
            and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity." 
            Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and 
            it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.
            But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em>
            "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a 
            formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave.
            But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing
            this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.

            But is the pop history of science only bad when it comes to
            religion?

            <h4>
                No, Pop History of Science Is Just Bad, 
                Whether It Deals with Religion or Not
            </h4>
        
              <p>
              Some of you may be inclined to suspect that I am rough on pop
              history because pop history is sometimes rough on religion. 
              This, despite the fact that I keep noting that serious historians
              who are atheists are pretty rough on the pop history of the church 
              versus science as well.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              But the latest episode of <i>Cosmos</i> dealt with an episode in 
              history where religion does not really enter in at all. And it 
              just completely bungs it up.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              For me, the most stunning howler was that Neil deGrasse 
              Tyson says that the Principia was where Newton introduced 
              calculus. Of course, it has no doubt been the topic of many 
              a PhD thesis to ask "Given Newton had already invented 
              calculus, why didn't he use it at all in the <i>Principia</i>?"
              </p>
        
              <p>
              In other words, the complete absence of calculus from 
              the Principia is a famous problem in the history of science. 
              But the scriptwriters for a show supposedly about 
              the history of science completely overlooked this, 
              and claimed instead that the Principia was where 
              calculus had been introduced!

              <h4>
                  Do Scientific Explanations Compete with Religious Explanations?
              </h4>
        
              <p>
              It is often imagined, by partisans of both science and
              religion, that those two domains are in rivalry for providing
              the "best" explanations of the nature of the world in which we 
              find ourselves. If there is a valid scientific explanation
              for, say, the origin of life on Earth, then any religious
              understanding of the topic is rendered superfluous. The consequence 
              is that many people who appreciate the accomplishments of science 
              conceive religion to be merely an impediment to scientific progress,
               while numerous religious folk feel compelled to reject the possibility
              of scientific explanations in some realm that they
              see as intimately tied to their beliefs.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              The idea behind this supposed conflict is that "God"
               serves as a kind of default causal mechanism invoked to explain
              anything not yet understood scientifically. 
              Thus, if current science has no explanation for the existence 
              of living creatures, then that is 
              seen -- superstitiously, according
              to one camp, or faithfully, according to the other -- 
              as evidence that there is still "room" for God
              in our world view. And, if scientific advances
              should conquer that problem, then it is hoped or 
              feared that the territory plausibly claimed by
              religion will be reduced by just the area 
              now newly occupied by science.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              I suggest that both sides in this battle are
              profoundly mistaken about the relation of religious
              and scientific "explanations," in that those two modes 
              of human understanding are categorically differentiated
              from each other, to the extant that "explanation"
              does not even mean the same thing in 
              one mode as it does in the other.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              I will attempt to clarify my contention through
              illustration. Consider the (highly improbable) case of a 
              society lacking even the most rudimentary scientific
              explanations of anything whatsoever. Everything that 
              happens is seen as merely a brute fact, accepted as 
              just an instance of "the way things are." That complete
              absence of scientific thinking leaves entirely undetermined
              the religious attitude of that society: the members
              might view these simply given conditions as representing
              an entirely arbitrary state of affairs that just 
              happens to be what faces them, or as resulting
              from the design/will/intention/self-expression
              of some divine power at their source.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Now, let's imagine these people hit upon the notion
              of natural regularities that govern the course of what
              previously seemed to be totally contingent, particular
              goings-on in the world. Perhaps they recognize that not 
              only did that apple and that rock and that stick fall 
              to the earth when dropped, but that that there is a 
              general tendency for any heavy object to do so. 
              Of what relevance is the emergence of this first 
              glimmering of scientific awareness to making a 
              choice between the two fundamental religious attitudes 
              described above? None at all, I contend: 
              It is true that the choice has been shifted 
              to a different level, but its essence is unaltered. 
              Now, the question is whether the general law 
              that heavy things will fall towards the earth 
              when unencumbered just happens to be the way 
              things are, or does it arise in accordance 
              with some greater order perceived as "sacred" in nature.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              If you have grasped the irrelevance of scientific 
              progress to the central religious issue in this 
              primitive case, it should be obvious that, 
              however far science travels beyond that first baby
              step, its findings cannot possibly substitute for religious
              understanding or adjudicate between the primary 
              and opposed answers to the question of God.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Nothing in the above musings is intended to 
              convince a sceptic that his negative conclusion 
              on the "God issue" is mistaken. Rather, I have 
              tried to show that the issue cannot be resolved by 
              scientific progress, since both positions regarding 
              it are compatible with any and all scientific findings. 
              I hope I have opened the minds of at least a few of the 
              many atheists whom I respect and admire to the 
              possibility that religious faith does not 
              represent an attempt to ignore the findings of 
              science or a rejection of rational inquiry,
              but is, instead, a different conception of the
              essential character of the stage upon
              which science and reason play their parts,
              a conception that cannot be dismissed 
              by quoting the lines that those actors speak.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              <b>A side note</b>: In discussing what constitutes 
              an explanation, it is interesting to note that 
              one of the most esteemed achievements in the entire
              history of science, Newton's theory of gravity, did 
              not actually provide any explanation of gravity at 
              all, at least not in a scientific sense. In lieu 
              of offering an answer as to why an apple fell to 
              the earth, he presented a quantitative law 
              giving the rate at which it did so, a substitution 
              for which he was roundly criticized by the 
              followers of Descartes, who accused him of 
              regressing to the "occult" and unscientific form 
              of natural philosophy prevalent in the Middle Ages. 
              However, Newton did have a personal preference 
              for explaining why gravity operated as it did: 
              he suggested that Spirit pervades the realm of 
              matter, and imbues all material objects with 
              mutual attraction. Ouch!

              <h4>Scientific Facts</h4>
        
              <p>
              A reader sent me an interesting note on whether or not evolution
              is "a fact" (see the chapter on "Darwin and Evolution" in this
              work), interesting because it clearly expresses the 
              "received view" of science, the one we all were taught in whatever formal 
              science courses we took in school.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              He contested the idea that all scientific facts are open to revision 
              with an example: "By fact I mean: when 
              I hold this pencil over the desk and let go, it falls to the desk."
              </p>
        
              <p>
              But did it? Or did the desk, and the rest of the Earth, rise up 
              to meet the pencil? Before I go any further 
              with this point, let me introduce another quote: "I don't think there 
              were all that many facts supporting geocentrism."
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Now, my correspondent might want to claim 
              that it is the plain and indisputable
              evidence of our senses that tells us that 
              the pencil falls towards the Earth, 
              rather than the Earth moving towards 
              the pencil. But, if he consistently 
              relies on this sort of argument, he will 
              wind up as an Aristotelean physicist, 
              defending geocentrism! After all, one 
              of the most convincing arguments for 
              geocentrism was that it is plainly evident to our senses that 
              the Sun is moving and the Earth is stationary. Galileo, in making 
              his case for heliocentrism, devoted a great deal of 
              effort to demonstrating that our senses 
              could mislead us about such matters.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              And, in fact, per Newton's theory of gravity, the Earth does 
              move up towards the pencil, if only a 
              minuscule distance -- Newton's 
              theory is one of mutual attraction, 
              so that the pencil is attracting 
              the Earth even as the Earth is attracting 
              the pencil. Although I don't 
              know that this specific argument 
              was actually made, an Aristotelean 
              might very well have rejected Newton's theory based on our clear 
              perception that the pencil is moving and the Earth is not.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              He goes on to say: "If there are no 'indisputable'
              facts as you say, 
              then I'm out of my league, but you 
              must be talking about philosophy. 
              I'm talking about hard science, where we must have some facts."
              </p>
        
              <p>
              This is a common way to attempt to maintain the Enlightenment view 
              of science in the face of recent developments in the philosophy and 
              the history of science -- dismiss philosophy as an ivory tower 
              enterprise with which "hard science" need not be concerned. 
              Now, it is true that the practicing scientist does not necessarily 
              need to be familiar with the ideas of the philosopher of science 
              to do his job. Nor is it the philosopher's business to dictate 
              correct practice to the scientist. However, as soon as one begins 
              to talk about the meaning of scientific results, their truth value, 
              and so on, one is, willy-nilly, engaged in philosophy. Indeed, the 
              question of what makes some activities "hard science" and others 
              not is a philosophical, not a scientific, one. (We can't answer it 
              scientifically because trying to do so assumes we already know what 
              makes an answer scientific -- but that is the very question on 
              the table!) The dismissal of philosophy of science as irrelevant 
              noodling about only results in the adoption of a philosophy of 
              science that has not been critically examined.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              As I noted at the top of this post, my correspondent's view is 
              representative of the notion of science commonly forwarded in science 
              education. Science, properly regarded, is a coherent, worthwhile, and, 
              at least to me, fascinating enterprise. But when it is portrayed 
              as the sole route to truth and knowledge, it is placed 
              in a role it cannot live up to, to the detriment of other 
              ways of comprehending human experience.
