                How Bad Is Pop History of Science?
            </h4>
      
            <p>
            Renaissance Mathematicus gives 
            <a href=
                "https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/scientific-american-craps-out/">
                an example here</a>. 
            The author of the piece critiqued -- which was
            published by <em>Scientific American!</em>
            -- puts forward nonsense like "Copernicus's system did not explain 
            retrograde motion of the planets" -- when, in fact, the 
            major advance of Copernicus's system was its natural explanation
            of retrograde motion! -- and that Galileo 
            "discovered that Venus was a planet and not a star" 
            -- something the ancient Greeks knew quite well. I studied the history
            of science for a year at King's College in London. 
            Pretty much the first thing our lecturer told us was that pop
            history of science was complete nonsense. And note: 
            although sometimes the junk pop history of science involves
            religious issues, nothing in the <em>Scientific American</em>
            piece has anything to do with such matters. It just seems that, 
            concerning the history of science, lots of people who have no
            idea what they are talking about want to publish on the topic.

            <h4>The (Ideological) History of Science</h4>
            
            <p>
            I just picked up The Scientists by John Gribbin. 
            I had thought I was bying a book on the history of science, 
            but unfortunately I've discovered I have bought a work of ideology
            disguised as history.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin opens by saying "The most important thing science has
            taught us about our place in the Universe is that we are not special."
            Oh really, and just how did science discover that "fact"? Is there some
            "specialness-omter" scientist have invented recently? What
            is the measure of "specialness" that proves Gribbin's assertion?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            There is none, for of course the assertion is sheer rubbish.
            The contention of Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, and so on is
            not that humanity is special in possessing some unique physical property
            -- which science might be able to disprove -- but that humanity
            is spiritually special. Buddhism, for instance, contends that
            humans are spiritually uniquely positioned to achieve enlightenment.
            Just how is science supposed to have "taught" us that this is not so?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            One of Gribbin's arguments for how science shows we
            are not special is the old chestnut about the Copernican
            system removing man from his "special" location at the center
            of the universe, a move that supposedly "demoted" man from a
            place of prime importance in creation. There is one
            rather serious problem with this oft-repeated tale:
            while it is true that, in Aristotelean and Medieval cosmologies,
            the center was a special place to be, that is because
            it was an especially bad place. For Aristotle,
            the center was where gross, corrupt matter descended,
            and it was the heavens that were perfect and unchanging,
            and the closest realm to God. As my lecturer in the
            history of science at King's College, John Milton, asked:
            Who was at the center of the universe in Dante's
            Divine Comedy? Why, Satan, of course, and hell!
            And Professor Milton mentioned that he could find
            no record of anyone at the time worried about Copernicus
            because man would no longer be at the center. This
            idea is almost certainly an invention of the same
            Enlightenment anti-clerical thinkers who invented
            "The Middle Ages," and who falsely alleged
            that Medieval natural philosophers held that the Earth is flat.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin continues: "It would have been natural
            [given the great ruins left by the Ancients] to
            accept that they were intellectually far superior to
            the ordinary people who had followed them, and to accept
            the teaching of the ancient philosophers such as Aristotle
            and Euclid as a kind of Holy Writ, which could not be questioned."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But that is precisely what Medieval thinkers did
            not do with Aristotle. Medieval thinkers generally
            considered themselves the superiors, not the inferiors,
            of the Ancients, because they had Christ's revelation at hand.
            Indeed, many Christian thinkers urged their fellows to
            ignore the Ancient philosophers as having nothing to teach
            Christians. And almost as soon as Aristotle's works
            were re-discovered, they were questioned. The Church
            issued edicts as to the many contentions of Aristotle's that
            had to be rejected. Buridan and Orseme seriously modified
            his mechanics. The idea that these people unthinkingly 
            accepted every word of Aristotle's is historical nonsense.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Euclid is a somewhat different story, for,
            while Euclid was unchallenged in the Middle Ages,
            so he was also by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton,
            and Kant! It was not until the 19th-century that
            non-Euclidean geometries were developed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            And, ironically, the attitude of inferiority to the
            Ancients really came to the fore with the rise of Humanism
            in the Renaissance -- just when Gribbin says it was ending!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Gribbin actually gets much, much better once
            he is done with the Middle Ages. I have the feeling
            he actually researched the period from 1450 on,
            whereas he just cribbed popular opinion for his 
            views on everything earlier.
            </p>
            
            <h4>The Rationality of Science</h4>
            
            
            <p>
            The great figures of the Scientific Revolution
            -- Galileo, Kepler, Newton -- were crystal clear on why
            science could be a rational enterprise: scientists
            were reading Nature, "the book of God"... and God being
            the supremely rational mind, naturally the book
            had a rational design, one that, with effort, 
            our more limited minds could follow.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The major part of the history of the philosophy 
            of science since the 18th-century has been the
            hunt to find some other, any other, basis for
            science's rationality. Once Hume destroyed
            the purely empiricist case for science,
            the search had an air of desperation to it.
            Instrumentalism, verificationism, falsificationism:
            all were attempts to patch up the hole Hume had noted.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            All these attempts have failed.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Pop history of science is often pretty terrible</h4>
            
            <p>
            <a href="http://thonyc.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/why-newtons-apple-is-not-a-good-story/">
            An actual historian</a> 
            looks at a pop "history" of science column and discovers it
            is about as accurate as an explanation of evolution that says, 
            "And one day a fish grew legs and walked up onto the land." 
            And Christie even missed a problem with the pop history account,
            in which Potter wrote "...how the young Newton, sent 
            home from school at Cambridge to avoid the plague of 1665,
            was sitting under a tree one day, saw an apple fall to the ground,
            and, in a flash of insight, came to understand the workings of gravity." 
            Christie notes that "the flash of insight" part is absurd, and 
            it took Newton another twenty years to put his thoughts in publishable form.
            But the problem Christie misses is the idea that Newton <em>ever</em>
            "came to understand the workings of gravity": he did not. He devised a 
            formula describing how objects under the influence of gravity would behave.
            But he had no model or theory of how gravity was producing
            this behavior, a fact which he readily admitted himself.

            <h4>
                No, Pop History of Science Is Just Bad, 
                Whether It Deals with Religion or Not
            </h4>
        
              <p>
              Some of you may be inclined to suspect that I am rough on pop
              history because pop history is sometimes rough on religion. 
              This, despite the fact that I keep noting that serious historians
              who are atheists are pretty rough on the pop history of the church 
              versus science as well.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              But the latest episode of Cosmos dealt with an episode in 
              history where religion does not really enter in at all. And it 
              just completely bungs it up.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              For me, the most stunning howler was that Neil deGrasse 
              Tyson says that the Principia was where Newton introduced 
              calculus. Of course, it has no doubt been the topic of many 
              a PhD thesis to ask "Given Newton had already invented 
              calculus, why didn't he use it at all in the Principia?"
              </p>
        
              <p>
              In other words, the complete absence of calculus from 
              the Principia is a famous problem in the history of science. 
              But the scriptwriters for a show supposedly about 
              the history of science completely overlooked this, 
              and claimed instead that the Principia was where 
              calculus had been introduced! 
              </p>
        
              <h4>
                  Do Scientific Explanations Compete with Religious Explanations?
              </h4>
        
              <p>
              It is often imagined, by partisans of both science and
              religion, that those two domains are in rivalry for providing
              the "best" explanations of the nature of the world in which we 
              find ourselves. If there is a valid scientific explanation
              for, say, the origin of life on Earth, then any religious
              understanding of the topic is rendered superfluous. The consequence 
              is that many people who appreciate the accomplishments of science 
              conceive religion to be merely an impediment to scientific progress,
               while numerous religious folk feel compelled to reject the possibility
              of scientific explanations in some realm that they
              see as intimately tied to their beliefs.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              The idea behind this supposed conflict is that "God"
               serves as a kind of default causal mechanism invoked to explain
              anything not yet understood scientifically. 
              Thus, if current science has no explanation for the existence 
              of living creatures, then that is 
              seen -- superstitiously, according
              to one camp, or faithfully, according to the other -- 
              as evidence that there is still "room" for God
              in our world view. And, if scientific advances
              should conquer that problem, then it is hoped or 
              feared that the territory plausibly claimed by
              religion will be reduced by just the area 
              now newly occupied by science.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              I suggest that both sides in this battle are
              profoundly mistaken about the relation of religious
              and scientific "explanations," in that those two modes 
              of human understanding are categorically differentiated
              from each other, to the extant that "explanation"
              does not even mean the same thing in 
              one mode as it does in the other.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              I will attempt to clarify my contention through
              illustration. Consider the (highly improbable) case of a 
              society lacking even the most rudimentary scientific
              explanations of anything whatsoever. Everything that 
              happens is seen as merely a brute fact, accepted as 
              just an instance of "the way things are." That complete
              absence of scientific thinking leaves entirely undetermined
              the religious attitude of that society: the members
              might view these simply given conditions as representing
              an entirely arbitrary state of affairs that just 
              happens to be what faces them, or as resulting
              from the design/will/intention/self-expression
              of some divine power at their source.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Now, let's imagine these people hit upon the notion
              of natural regularities that govern the course of what
              previously seemed to be totally contingent, particular
              goings-on in the world. Perhaps they recognize that not 
              only did that apple and that rock and that stick fall 
              to the earth when dropped, but that that there is a 
              general tendency for any heavy object to do so. 
              Of what relevance is the emergence of this first 
              glimmering of scientific awareness to making a 
              choice between the two fundamental religious attitudes 
              described above? None at all, I contend: 
              It is true that the choice has been shifted 
              to a different level, but its essence is unaltered. 
              Now, the question is whether the general law 
              that heavy things will fall towards the earth 
              when unencumbered just happens to be the way 
              things are, or does it arise in accordance 
              with some greater order perceived as "sacred" in nature.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              If you have grasped the irrelevance of scientific 
              progress to the central religious issue in this 
              primitive case, it should be obvious that, 
              however far science travels beyond that first baby
              step, its findings cannot possibly substitute for religious
              understanding or adjudicate between the primary 
              and opposed answers to the question of God.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              This post is, of course, an extended 
              statement of a view I have expressed less fully
              in a few earlier posts on this blog, for instance, 
              in noting that Zeus was not a really piss-poor attempt 
              at a scientific explanation of thunder, but a poetic 
              representation of the sense of awe and the presence 
              of a greater power that one can experience 
              when faced with an intense thunderstorm.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              Nothing in the above musings is intended to 
              convince a sceptic that his negative conclusion 
              on the "God issue" is mistaken. Rather, I have 
              tried to show that the issue cannot be resolved by 
              scientific progress, since both positions regarding 
              it are compatible with any and all scientific findings. 
              I hope I have opened the minds of at least a few of the 
              many atheists whom I respect and admire to the 
              possibility that religious faith does not 
              represent an attempt to ignore the findings of 
              science or a rejection of rational inquiry,
              but is, instead, a different conception of the
              essential character of the stage upon
              which science and reason play their parts,
              a conception that cannot be dismissed 
              by quoting the lines that those actors speak.
              </p>
        
              <p>
              A SIDE NOTE: In discussing what constitutes 
                an explanation, it is interesting to note that 
               one of the most esteemed achievements in the entire
              history of science, Newton's theory of gravity, did 
              not actually provide any explanation of gravity at 
              all, at least not in a scientific sense. In lieu 
              of offering an answer as to why an apple fell to 
              the earth, he presented a quantitative law 
              giving the rate at which it did so, a substitution 
              for which he was roundly criticized by the 
              followers of Descartes, who accused him of 
              regressing to the "occult" and unscientific form 
              of natural philosophy prevalent in the Middle Ages. 
              However, Newton did have a personal preference 
              for explaining why gravity operated as it did: 
              he suggested that Spirit pervades the realm of 
              matter, and imbues all material objects with 
              mutual attraction. Ouch!

              <h4>Scientific Facts</h4>

              A reader sent me an interesting note in response 
              to my recent post, "Evolution: A Fact?," 
              interesting because it clearly expresses the 
              "received view" of science, the one
              we all were taught in whatever formal 
              science courses we took in school.

              He contested the idea that all scientific 
              facts are open to revision 
              with an example: "By fact I mean: when 
              I hold this pencil over the desk 
              and let go, it falls to the desk."
              </p>
        
              <p>
              But did it? Or did the desk, and the rest of the Earth, rise up 
              to meet the pencil? Before I go any further 
              with this point, let me 
              introduce another quote: "I don't think there 
              were all that many facts
              supporting geocentrism."

              Now, my correspondent might want to claim 
              that it is the plain and indisputable
              evidence of our senses that tells us that 
              the pencil falls towards the Earth, 
              rather than the Earth moving towards 
              the pencil. But, if he consistently 
              relies on this sort of argument, he will 
              wind up as an Aristotelean physicist, 
              defending geocentrism! After all, one 
              of the most convincing arguments for 
              geocentrism was that it is plainly evident to our senses that 
              the Sun is moving and the Earth is stationary. Galileo, in making 
              his case for heliocentrism, devoted a great deal of 
              effort to demonstrating that our senses 
              could mislead us about such matters.

              And, in fact, per Newton's theory of gravity, the Earth does 
              move up towards the pencil, if only a 
              minuscule distance -- Newton's 
              theory is one of mutual attraction, 
              so that the pencil is attracting 
              the Earth even as the Earth is attracting 
              the pencil. Although I don't 
              know that this specific argument 
              was actually made, an Aristotelean 
              might very well have rejected Newton's theory based on our clear 
              perception that the pencil is moving and the Earth is not.

              He goes on to say: "If there are no 'indisputable'
              facts as you say, 
              then I'm out of my league, but you 
              must be talking about philosophy. 
              I'm talking about hard science, where we must have some facts."

              This is a common way to attempt to maintain the Enlightenment view 
              of science in the face of recent developments in the philosophy and 
              the history of science -- dismiss philosophy as an ivory tower 
              enterprise with which "hard science" need not be concerned. 
              Now, it is true that the practicing scientist does not necessarily 
              need to be familiar with the ideas of the philosopher of science 
              to do his job. Nor is it the philosopher's business to dictate 
              correct practice to the scientist. However, as soon as one begins 
              to talk about the meaning of scientific results, their truth value, 
              and so on, one is, willy-nilly, engaged in philosophy. Indeed, the 
              question of what makes some activities "hard science" and others 
              not is a philosophical, not a scientific, one. (We can't answer it 
              scientifically because trying to do so assumes we already know what 
              makes an answer scientific -- but that is the very question on 
              the table!) The dismissal of philosophy of science as irrelevant 
              noodling about only results in the adoption of a philosophy of 
              science that has not been critically examined.

              As I noted at the top of this post, my correspondent's view is 
              representative of the notion of science commonly forwarded in science 
              education. Science, properly regarded, is a coherent, worthwhile, and, 
              at least to me, fascinating enterprise. But when it is portrayed 
              as the sole route to truth and knowledge, it is placed 
              in a role it cannot live up to, to the detriment of other 
              ways of comprehending human experience.
