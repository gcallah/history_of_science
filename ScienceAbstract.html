    <h4>
        Science Does Not Deal with Concrete Reality
    </h4>
        
        <p>
            "All the matters about which science speaks, whatever the science be,
            are abstract, and abstract things are always clear. So that the clarity
            of science is not so much in the heads of scientists as in the matters
            of which they speak. What is really confused, intricate, is the
            concrete vital reality, always a unique thing." -- Jose Ortega y
            Gasset, <i>The Revolt of the Masses</i>, p. 156

    <h4>
    The "Scientific World-View"
    </h4>

        <p>
        "Nothing carries so much authority today as science, but there is
        actually no such thing as 'the scientific world-view'. Science is a
        method of inquiry, not a view of the world. Knowledge is growing at
        accelerating speed; but no advance in science will tell us whether
        materialism is true or false, or whether humans possess free will. The
        belief that the world is composed of matter is metaphysical
        speculation, not a testable theory." -- John Gray, <i>The Soul of the
            Marionette</i>, p. 151
        </p>

        <p>
        Gray is, by the way, an atheist, and a materialist of some sort or
        another, so this is certainly not a case of religious nostalgia
        resisting scientific advances, but simply a philosopher who correctly
        understands what science can and can't tell us about.

    <h4>
        Prediction and Science
    </h4>
        <p>
            Some people contend that successful prediction of the hallmark of
            science. "If economics is a science, why is it so bad at prediction?"
            they ask.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But they fail to notice how little of the real world physics can
            predict. I was sitting in my diner this morning as I was composing
            this, with the jukebox playing and people talking. I thought of what
            parts of the world around me a physicist could predict with any decent
            degree of accuracy:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>What sound waves will reach my ear in one minute? Not a chance.
    
            <li>Where will my oldest son be in fours hours? Hell, I can't predict that!
    
            <li>When will a complex assemblage of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates
            arrive in the space in front of me? Sometime in the next ten minutes: a
            physicist would do worse than anyone who is a regular at the diner.
    
            <li>At what times during the Spurs-Pelicans game tonight will the
            basketball pass through the net? No.
    
            <li>Where will the maple seed falling off the tree on the street outside
            land? Well, within a few hundred feet, maybe.
    
            <li>What will be the first star visible in the (partly cloudy) sky this
            evening? No.
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            On the stove, one of the chefs was boiling some water. About the only
            thing of interest going on around me that a physicist could have
            predicted was how long it would take the water to boil. And that is
            because the water has deliberately been put in a constrained,
            artificial set up, in the limited space of a uniformly conductive pot
            and over the steady heat of a carefully designed flame, precisely to
            make its time to boiling predictable... much like the way physicists
            set up an experimental environment.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Scientific prediction is not about the real world as a whole: it is
            about a world of pure quantity <i>abstracted</i> from the real world.
        </p>

    <h4>
        Science Can't Tell Us What an Electron Is
    </h4>

        <p>
            The world of science is an abstraction. It discovers that electrons
            stand in certain quantitative relationships to protons, and so forth.
            Whitehead suggests that this is because they "prehend" the proton and
            react to it in a certain way. This is a philosophical position, and
            science can have nothing significant to say about it, other than,
            "Whether or not electrons prehend protons, that is no part of the
            abstractions with which we deal."
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Similarly, science says nothing at all about what migraine headaches
            "really are." It traces out certain quantitative relationships in human
            physiology that occur before or along with a migraine. If someone
            suggests that these changes are the result of a demon entering the
            sufferer's body, all science can say is, "Well, the demon doesn't
            appear in our equations."
        </p>
    
        <p>
            But, of course, neither do the sights, sounds and smells of the real
            world. So not showing up in a scientific equation is no sign of
            irreality.

    <h4>
        History, Queen of the Sciences
    </h4>
    
        <p>
        The late Sudha Shenoy once said to me, "They are
        approaching this theoretically, but the real world
        is historical, not theoretical." 
        </p>
    
        <p>
        I've thought about that remark a lot since then,
        and I think I have an idea what Sudha was saying.
        All of special sciences abstract as part of their
        essential nature: they are constituted by the style of
        abstraction in which they engage. If physics stopped
        looking at the world only in terms of forces and motions,
        and began, say, taking emotions and plans into 
        account, it would cease being physics.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        But history is only abstract accidentally: the historian
        and her readers are human beings, and no one has 
        time to read or write everything that happened. Nevertheless,
        as details are added and abstractness reduced, the work 
        becomes more, not less, historical. So history comes closer
        to the real world than any theoretical science can.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        An interesting corollary here is that, far
        from history being a sad stepchild of the "real,"
        experimental sciences, that would adopt their methods 
        if only it could, in fact, the experimental sciences are
        utterly dependent upon history. (This was noted by Collingwood decades ago.)
        </p>
    
        <p>
        The idea of an experiment itself is an historical achievement
        on the part of a historical group of people. There is no general
        experiment to see if something counts as a genuine experiment, for how
        would we know if that "experiment-testing" experiment was itself
        a genuine experiment? No, it is through an exercise in historical
        understanding that scientists determine if something counts as
        an experiment, as they consult the history of successful and of
        failed experiments in their discipline, and see how the one in
        question appears in light of that record. And it is through
        their historical understanding of a series of such experiments
        done in the past that scientists judge that a theory
        is discredited, or worth testing further, or so well-confirmed
        that there is no sense bothering to check it further (at present).
        </p>
    
        <p>
        The experimental sciences are dependent on history.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Not experimental tests for what counts as an experiment.

    <h4>Science Often Ignores Counter-Evidence</h4>

        <p>
        ... and damned right it should!
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Have you ever heard of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Bessler#Orffyreus.27s_wheels">
        Orffyreus's Wheel?</a>
        In the 1700s, a rather eccentric personage named Johann Bessler was 
        exhibiting a perpetual motion machine in Europe. Several 
        prominent scientists examined it and were unable 
        to determine how it worked. There were allegations 
        of fraud, but the method of fraud supposedly employed 
        would not have been possible if first hand accounts 
        of the wheel's operation were accurate. 
        (Note: it is an historical problem to determine 
        what actually was occurring! Science depends upon history.)
        </p>    
    
        <p>
        In any case, scientists simply ignored 
        this unsolved problem, and went on as if 
        the belief in the impossibility of a perpetual 
        motion machine had never been challenged. 
        And good for them that they did! For science to 
        proceed forward, contrary observations must often 
        be disregarded. Michael Polanyi notes that a very 
        similar thing happened in the 1920s, when a 
        (this time) serious scientist presented multiple 
        observations confirming the existence of the ether. 
        But, by this time, scientists were fully convinced 
        there was no need for this hypothesized entity, 
        and simply ignored the observations. Again, 
        history has proven that to have been a sound judgment.
        <p>
    
        <p>
        How does one know when to pay attention to contrary 
        observations and when to ignore them? Well, 
        making that judgment well is why it takes years 
        of training to become a good scientist. There is no 
        rule or algorithm that can be learned from a high school 
        textbook that can make the judgment for you.

    <h4>The 'Irrationality" of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics</h4>

        <p>
        If you search the net a bit you can find many claims for the 
        "irrationality" of relativity and quantum mechanics. I've just 
        picked two at random here, but there are thousands like this:
        </p>
    
        <p>
        "Near the origin of relativity is the claim that the velocity
        of light is determined by the receiving point. Effect supposedly 
        precedes cause. Everyone knows something cannot be caused after 
        it occurs. That claim is not allowed anyplace."
        -- Here.
        </p>
    
    
        <p>
        "The Natural Philosophy Alliance (NPA) is devoted mainly to 
        broad-ranging, fully open-minded criticism, at the most fundamental
        levels , of the often irrational and unrealistic doctrines of 
        modern physics and cosmology; and to the ultimate replacement of these 
        doctrines by much sounder ideas developed with full respect for evidence, logic, and objectivity."
        -- (The group's site is down right now, so no link!)
        </p>
    
       <p>
       Now, certain "Austrians" have, quite detrimentally to the greater 
       acceptance of Austrian economics, linked such crank physics to the 
       Austrian programme in economics. This rejection of mathematical or 
       physical findings due to their "irrationality" is a phenomenon which 
       has arisen again and again in the history of science and mathematics. 
       In every single case given to us by history, it later became clear that the 
       "irrationality" was entirely that of the "rationalist" critics, who were 
       unable to extend their own thought processes to embrace the rationality 
       of the new mathematical or physical findings.
       </p>
    
       <p>
       Here are just a few cases which some advance in physics or mathematics
       was deemed "irrational" by numerous "rationalists" at the time it occurred:
       </p>
    
       <p>
       <b>Irrational numbers:</b> It is said that the Pythagorean who first discovered 
       that the square root of two is irrational drowned himself.
       </p>
     
       <p>
       <b>Negative numbers:</b> How can there be less than zero of something?
       </p>
    
       <p>
       <b>Imaginary numbers:</b> Hey, they're imaginary, aren't they?
       </p>
    
       <p>
       <b>Heliocentrism:</b> Critics of Copernicus said his model was crazy -- which, 
       from the point of view of Aristotelean physics, it was.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       <b>Action at a distance:</b> Huyghens and Leibniz, amongst others, chided 
       Newton for re-introducing "occult" forces into science.
       </p>
    
       <p>
       What is quite striking is the each new wave of critics of the 
       advance of science and mathematics holds as 'a priori' conditions of 
       'rationality' <em>precisely those physical and mathematical findings of 
       earlier generations that were previously held to be the height of 
       'irrationality'!</em> Surveying this process, we can easily discern what 
       is occurring: for many people, intellectual growth has ceased by, 
       say, 20 or 25. Whatever concepts they have absorbed by that point 
       in their lives are deemed 'rational'. Any new concepts they 
       encounter after that point are 'irrational'.
       </p>
    
       <p>
       Relativity and quantum mechanics, as shown by the great 
       Ernst Cassirer in what is, perhaps, the best book on the 
       philosophy of science I have read, entitled <em>Determinancy and 
       Indeterminancy in Physics,</em> are as fully rational as -- and, 
       in some ways more rational than -- ealier paradigms of physical 
       investigation. What's irrational is to reject the findings 
       of modern science because they strain your brain.
